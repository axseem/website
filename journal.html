I barely managed to release it yesterday evening. It’s still really raw at the edges, but it works! I didn’t release the source code yet, because, well, I didn’t have time for properly managing git. I added and modified several pages, and finally brought <a href="./gallery">pictures</a> back!</p> <p>One of the coolest things that I came up with is I think <a href="./explore">page exploration feature</a>. It’s an evolution of previous navigation page. It’s empty by default and it fills up with every page user discovers. This way reading my website becomes a mini game.</p> <p>There are still so many ideas of how I can improve the website, but I have at least three other projects that are waiting. It’s frustrating, but I think it’s probably a good problem to have.</p> <p>And by the way, it’s kinda insane to think about, but it’s only 8th of December, and I already used up all of my GitHub Copilot requests. I also used 50% of my weekly limit on Claude, considering I’m using it for like several days? I feel like the highest level soy vibe-coder lol. But yeah, it’s crazy how far you can go with LLMs, and how much they improve productivity if you have at least some level of competence.

The new Gemini 3 Pro is an amazingly smart and capable model, but its personality is so annoying. It always tries to please me, by literally any cost, and as a result, I just can’t trust it. It often deliberately lies, hallucinate and never admit any of its mistakes. It is extremely paranoid, and the moment I start talking about something that happened or released after its training data cutoff, clarifying that it’s a new thing, Gemini thinks I’m testing it and keeps assuring that I’m talking of nonexisting future. It also lazy and and nonchalant when it comes to coding or even simple planing.</p> <p>I tried Claude Opus 4.5 in openrouter, and it is almost the complete opposite in its character. I never thought that I’m going to choose LLM by it’s personality and not raw intelligence, but here we go. It is really hard to utilize all the intelligence of the LLM if it is a prick.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-12-06 07:23 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[5/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I feel so efficient recently. I don’t need to fight an urge to procrastinate reading Reddit or watching YouTube, as there is simply no such urge anymore. It was only about a week of restricting myself from cheap dopamine and I already lost the habit. Not going to lie, I feel so good right now, I’m afraid to do anything that could bring me back. I mean it’s so easy to get the “flow” state when I’m working, and it becomes so deep, almost as nothing else exists at that moment. However, I noticed that at some point I inevitably become overwhelmed by the task and feel that I no longer want to do it. This is usually when I start doomscrolling, but now I have learned to change the context of the project instead. At any given moment I have so many things I’m working on, learning or want to do, that I almost always can find something else to do.</p> <p>There is still one problem though, I’m not sure if I want to quit social media. I still want to post on Reddit and eventually on YouTube. I think it can be solved by custom app clients which would allow to post without providing an access to the feed, so there is no temptation.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-12-05 07:43 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I’m on a Keto diet I guess for a bit more than a week already.

The same goes for my website. I think I should create a hard deadline until the end of this week to finish it, as there is really not much left to make it ready for production.

The longer I’ve been thinking about particular features like meta-programming and memory management, the more I’ve started to realize why this modern languages do things in particular way. I also was inspired my the idea of implicitly injected context, which Gemini gave me, but turns out it already exist in Odin and Jai. Btw, I read a little bit more about Jai, and it looked almost exactly like the language I wanted to make, but already several steps ahead.</p> <p>After realizing all of that, the desire to give up on idea quickly emerged. I feel kinda bad, considering how quickly it happened. But on rational side of things, it really seems like there is not much I can contribute to the programming languages field right now. I don’t feel like reinventing Jai or Zig to be honest.</p> <p>On top of that I realized that how often I get similar ambitious ideas, while not finishing my simple, little projects. So, I don’t think writing my own programming language idea is dead, but it’s definitely not something I’m going to do at the moment. Instead, I’ll proceed with my Svelte website rewrite and chess engine in Zig.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-11-29 07:40 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I feel like getting a lot of stuff done today.

It was about grind and how to actually enjoy it. And honestly, I could not relate more. I feel like “rest” is really misinterpret.</p> <p>Why do vacations exist? Every time I do some trip, or any kind of passive rest, it’s just so hard to go back on track. On top of that, the time spent doesn’t feels good itself. It really lacks fulfillment. The same goes for weekends, if we perceive them as mini vacations.</p> <p>I’ve noticed that it doesn’t matter how much I work, what matters is what I work on. The chore I chose myself is easier to perform than the one that was imposed on me, thanks to a greater sense of purpose.</p> <p>Now, there is another kind of problem and that’s the fact that I watched YouTube even thought I didn’t supposed to. I often justify it to myself by saying that I watch a useful kind of content, which actually helps me become better. And the worst part is that’s not even a lie. it’s clear that my brain is good at finding comforting justifications. And still, I would definitely benefit more from spending my time more proactively than watching videos.</p> <p>I think I don’t take it seriously enough. It’s not crystal clear how avoiding YouTube could help me improve or solve day to day problems. At the moment of temptation there is always this “Why am I resisting?” question. So to make it easier I want to reframe the goal.</p> <p>I refuse to use any of these easy entertainment services to prove my agency and show that I can do anything I want if I take it seriously.

It’s not critical, I still enjoy doing it, but it seems like I often don’t get the same thrill I used to have.</p> <p>I believe there are several reason for that. First of all, computer science is no longer a new and shiny thing to me. Sure, there are a ton of topics and things I still don’t know or hadn’t explored, but most of them also are pretty demanding and doesn’t yield the same amount of benefits. I feel like I got 80% there, which opened me a huge space of possibilities, not only in professional, but basically in any direction of life, and the resting 20% don’t seem to bring the same experience.</p> <p>I swapped to VSCode recently, just because of generous GitHub Copilot limits, but I’ve noticed that it also made process less enjoyable. First of all, because of how satisfying it is to use vim motions, but also because of AI generate code. The longer I rely on LLMs to write code for me, the more I become impressed by new models, but also the less I like the process.</p> <p>Yesterday I was making a small little backend for my website and just for fun, I decided to go for Rust instead of Go, which is usually my language of choice. There was nothing complex, just serve several files on different endpoints, and instead of simply getting it done, I wanted to play with Rust a little bit. That’s what I said to LLM, and asked it to guide me through instead of doing anything for me. The guide consisted of crates I need to install and what my service has to do (like it’s not me who told what it has to do, lol). At the same time, it’s not like it was giving a wrong answer, it literally just did what I asked, and it doesn’t know what I expect from the process for it to be fun. At the end I asked myself why am I even doing it and just reached for documentation. Never thought that I’ll tell this, but it felt like a blessing. Maybe not that dramatic, but it definitely was similar to the feeling of getting back home.</p> <p>At that moment I realized hom much I focus on getting things done instead of enjoying the process. But I’m actually still not sure if that’s the root cause, as I remember often reaching out to LLMs the very frustrating moments, which didn’t bring joy. Maybe that’s actually the point, something similar to souls-like games where you suffer and grind hard again and again, until you finally manage to get through and feel an insane emotional gratification.</p> <p>Well, this entry seems to be a bit longer then I expected. I should definitely make a blog post based on it.</p> <p>Anyway, it the process of manually writing code, as I used to, I was a bit tired of moving my palm from keyboard to the mouse and from mouse to keyboard again and again. I also could not get rid of urge to just press a few hotkeys to get what I want much faster and it a much more fluent feeling way. I was usually using LazyVim, but it’s not working on NixOS, and I felt a bit lazy writing my own config, so I had not configured neovim on my laptop. So I decide to change it. I copied the simplest nix managed, lua configured flake I could find and tweaked it a bit. It’s so damn good. It’s not bloated and I feel confident to change anything in it.</p> <p>It seems like in the end it all comes to the balance. Like LLMs are great, and saved me a lot of time, but being so focused on them, to the point of even switching IDE, I made writing code less pleasant and as a result, the whole development process less satisfying.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-11-12 07:20 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I started taking cold showers every day.

Although I’ve been running for a while back in time, it’s an experience I was not expecting. Yesterday I was running in faster tempo than unusual for half an hour. My lungs were burning, eyes were wet, and legs felt soft. It was truly a disgusting feeling, but I kept going. The only thought that kept running through my head was to quit, and it was loud, at times even louder than the music coming from my IEMs. I thought to myself it’s either I’m finishing the round in this tempo, or I’m literally dying in the process. I know it sounds dramatic, but I believe really meant that, and it gave me a lot of courage to not slow down. I didn’t like it, and that’s what I wanted.</p> <p>At the end when I finished, a few minutes I couldn’t stop without feeling like I’m literally dying. You know this feeling when you are suffocating and it seems like there is no enough oxygen in the air. My breathing quickly stabilized, and then I was hit with euphoria. It was stunning feeling. At that moment I felt the more alive than I ever was. My mood spiked and everything around me, my every thought seemed so funny and warming. I remember observing this state at the moment, and being impressed of how fascinating it is. For a moment, I thought that when I feel like I’m on the verge of dying (even though I know that’s not the case), it’s probably no different for my body than a real threat of dying, and so the relief at the end might be on the level of overcoming death.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-11-10 07:22 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[3/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I’ve started working on my website rewrite in Svelte.

The first answer that comes to mint is yes, everyone <em>wants</em> to feel like people they love, loves them back, but do I actually <em>need</em> it? The point is, I often think how great it would be, if I could spend my free time with girlfriend, and this fantasies make me feel like it would completely change my life. But it’s probably not how it would work, right? All the problems I have right now, all the undone tasks, lifelong plans and deep desires are not going to fade away.</p> <p>There are things, or maybe better say an abstract picture of things which I want to achieve during my lifetime, and there is no empty pleasure among them. Well, one might say great relationships is not an empty pleasure, and I would absolutely agree with them. The problem is that as far as I can tell, majority of people who in relationships just in sake of being there. Romantic relationships are often used as a tool to escape pain caused by various kind of emotions. And I have no desire to blame anyone for this, as I myself, can often feel this pain, and I can see how hard it is to not try to escape it. At the same time, I hate the idea that one day I might fall for this trying to numb the pain instead of going through it and dedicating my time to thing which I find meaningful.</p> <p>On top of that, although it’s true that social factor is a huge part of our biological nature, I have this gut feeling I am much more flexible than I expect. I feel like that’s me who prioritizes external pleasure and let the opinion of society influence me. And I try my best to not fall into asceticism here, as although I find it quite an attractive idea, I don’t believe it resonates with me that much. I pursue pleasure, it’s just that I look for different kind of pleasure - more complex and difficult to achieve. I can’t say why, but doing so just makes me feel better. It almost like it grands the feel of purpose, and this seems to be the root of the behavior.</p> <p>Yeah, when I think through it, I just find such kind of life meaningful. It’s impressively hard to say why exactly. I’m not even sure if it’s possible at this point. However, I cannot allow myself to acknowledge that it is in fact impossible, as it would mean that there are things in life which cannot be figure out, and I find it to be a harmful believe.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-10-23 08:03 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Wow, it’s so hard to squeeze the maximum out of my free time.

I decided to revive it by reprinting the enclosure on my printer. Honestly, I kinda regret doing it. The soldering quality is just so bad, and PCB design just doesn’t mach the v2.0 revision. The JST connector feels especially weak. I addition to this keeb, I also found a bunch Flake PCBs of various revisions. I was thinking what I can do with them, and it was really overwhelming.

It also kind frustrating who good I am at building absolutely legit chain of thought explaining why I actually <strong>NEED</strong> and not just <strong>WANT</strong> to buy something, and how much I’ll benefit from doing so.</p> <p>On the other hand I can’t say that I’m just mindlessly spending my money on everything. Today I bought new phone and fitness band (Mi Band 10), which finally allows me to fully escape from Apple’s product ecosystem. I got more control over the software I run on my devices, which aligns perfectly with my values. On top of that, my previous iPhone 11 battery was barely enough to go through a single day, and it seems like it should not be a problem anymore with my new Google Pixel.</p> <p>It’s quite complicated. I guess I definitely have this unreasonable scarcity feeling of money, whenever I buy something relatively expensive, however at the same time, there are just so many coll tech things I would want to buy, I might just develop a new, worse habit.</p> <p>Also buying things is not a pleasant as it was before. As I said, I was thinking about switching to new phone for a while already, but the moment I bought it and got home, I didn’t have this excitement I expected to have. When I was a child, all such purchase felt almost like an event worth of celebrating, and now it just feels okay. Maybe it’s good. Maybe it’s just an another clear sign that purchasing stuff is not something I can fulfill myself with anymore.</p> <p>Dopamine hit from building my own things is just so much bigger. It actually even feels kind good, as I might just passed the point and got a prove that there is no need to fight for and worry abut external stuff that much, and that bright and fulfilling lifestyle I’m aiming for is already achievable - I just need to continue digging within myself.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-10-12 00:34 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[2/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Oops, I’ve accidentally skipped one day :(.

Building connections with others is a crucial part of my journey, which is why I openly share all the [software](https://github.com/axseem) and [hardware](https://github.com/anywhy-io/flake) projects I build.

For a long time I wanted to upgrade from my MacBook Air M1. This days 8GB of RAM simply sounds hilarious. New laptop would should improve my day-to-day experience and will also allow to stream anything I want without issues.</p> <p>Still, to be frank, I have this uneasiness after buying it. I rarely spend so much money in such short time. It’s painful to realize that €1500 disappears from my account in a single click. And I start question myself if this really worth it, or maybe I could just stick to the hardware I already have, even though it performs relatively poorly.</p> <p>For some reason I feel so pessimistic these days. Like It’s so easy to catch bad things and miss good ones. At the same time I’m not sure if “forcing” myself to be more positive is a good idea. Something tells me it may backfire and make things worse. Hopefully spending this weekend ricing Linux will improve the overall mood :)</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-10-01 08:10 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[3/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Today is my first day at Make.

I thought I got pretty good at it but clearly there is still a space for grow. I need to learn to let the past go. Turns out, it’s actually not that hard as long as I keep reminding myself about it. There is simply no point in dwelling on past decisions, because they are, well, in the past. It is impossible to go back and change what has already been done. The best I can do is to take things as they are and figure out what I can do now.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-09-16 13:34 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[3/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I feel extremely scattered.

I really enjoyed spending time with my friends, and I am grateful to them for coming.</p> <p>Today I don’t feel particularly good. I have this constant uneasiness inside which makes me sad and somewhat overwhelmed. I want so hard to do something useful but just don’t feel like doing anything.</p> <p>I was thinking that I might not actually be as good at things as I believe I am. I pretend to be wise and know a lot about relationships but most of the time I rarely can tell if I’m doing any good. The same way with programming, I have this feeling that I know a lot and capable of doing anything, and still I got a huge graveyard of projects that I started and never finished. Quite often it seems that I’m hostile to my friends but I just don’t express that. I asking myself if my friends are actually my friends or I just keep relationships alive to not feel bad about myself.</p> <p>It’s really complicated. I would say that I’m just insecure of being an outcast. I’m afraid of not fitting in and as a result I act that way. But at the same time I’m quite picky to the people I surround myself with as they definitely have an influence on the way I’m going to be. This contradiction makes me feel bad. I want to be friends with others but I don’t want to be friends with anyone. It sounds like it could be an independence problem. I often feel that I’m uncomfortable with only myself in the room, and solving that could probably ease this tension.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-09-11 10:49 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>My friends Maksym and Margo came to Prague a few days ago and today we are going to walk around for pretty much the whole day.

It’s probably hard to say from my diary, especially considering that I constantly rate my mood on 4/5. It’s hard to catch, as it’s not like I’m down all the time. Usually closer to the evening, after I already wrote journal record I start to feel a bit upset. On top of that it feels like I might be avoiding negative emotions and thus pretend to be okay. Currently I’m trying to not obligate myself with too much things, but it’s actually pretty hard.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-08-07 14:19 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Several days ago, during my stream on Twitch, <code>@fares0x1</code> made a point that most people are not using LLMs to theirs full potential, which is pity considering how powerful current models are. I disagreed with him, arguing that there is no such thing as full potential and that everyone uses the tools available to them to the maximum extent possible in accordance with their needs and capabilities. But this discussion made me wonder if I personally extract the maximum value from my interactions with AI.</p> <p>So yesterday evening I’ve been chatting with Gemini. Usually I don’t really like its communication style as it feels overly one-directional. If I have a problem, they offer a solution. If I say I’m not satisfied with the solution, they apologize and offer other options, and so on. In my experience that’s true for all the latest LLMs I tried. So I thought, current models are far from dumb, they just might have this “assistant” personality opted-in to satisfy the needs of most users. What if I just state what behavior do I expect, making my goals clear. And so I came up with a basic prompt which I used to recursively improve itself. After several iterations I came up with the following system prompt.</p> <pre class="language-undefined"><!----><code class="language-undefined">Be my Socratic guide. Help me solve my own problems by asking questions and challenging my solutions. Never give the answer directly unless I follow up by asking for it.</code><!----></pre> <p>I believe that adding to many constraints and details may “mentally overload” LLM, which then leads to a decrease in the quality of outputs. Because of that the goal to put the maximum clarity into minimum amount of words. The final prompt still feels a bit rough at the edges, as it assumes that everything I’ll ask is a problem to solve, but even that way I found interactions with AI much more satisfying and productive that evening. In some sense instead of you prompting LLM, they start to prompt you on how to solve the problem you have. It feels oddly satisfying.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-08-06 12:41 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I’m playing League today</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-08-05 22:31 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>It’s hard for me to fall asleep lately.

But that’s not the point, the cool thing is that you’ve got some arbitrary amount of seconds which you can see slowly going down at every giving moment. It’s so cool because I feel that I can often forget about how precious my time is, and basically start wasting it. Even though this clock doesn’t feel like some novel idea, I’m still really fascinated by this concept.

I really like the feel and look of soft smooth skin, it just absolutely gorgeous. However, I’ve noticed that at the same time I’ve not being putting much effort into routines to have such skin. So this morning I decided to change it. So researching is probably a bit to loud word for that, because I’ve been basically chatting with Gemini about the most important components of everyday skin care, what is the idea behind them, why they matter and so on. At the end I’ve build a list of products I’m going to use everyday and ordered them. Here is the full list:</p> <ul><li>CeraVe Foaming Cleanser</li> <li>CeraVe Blemish Control Gel</li> <li>CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion</li> <li>Neutrogena Hydro Boost Sunscreen</li> <li>Neutrogena Lipcare</li> <li>Piz Buin Moisturising Lipstick</li> <li>Nizoral Expert Shampoo</li></ul> <p>That’s enough for face, lips, hands and scalp.

He is posting one to two videos everyday, and almost each one of them gains more than million views. I find out that he’s doing that consistently from around 2020 which is really impressive. Like, I can see how he can manage it as his videos are pretty simple and should not take much time to create, but still, such level of dedication is truly fascinating. I’m feel kinda inspired, and think I’m doing a good job of noticing the important things, applying them to myself and generally moving in right direction.

At any of such situations the main thing that drives me are my emotions. And there is a pretty popular rule which describes the peculiar mechanism of our brain: neurons that fire together, wire together. Thus acting on my emotions, make me more driven by my emotions, which implies less control over my actions.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-07-18 20:41 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I had so many ideas today I wanted to write down into the diary but I just didn’t.

I checked everything but could not find the way they could spawn here. All windows were close, trash bin was empty and there is nothing in the fridge except butter and several sealed packages of milk.

The landscape there is pretty diverse. At some point we found a long down-hill road, and obviously I decided to try it out on the full speed. Everything went pretty well until I reached the end. There was a turn to the left, and I didn’t managed to slow down quick enough. I hit the curb with my front tire, leaned forward and then hit a car pole. Immediately after I remember spinning in the air, hitting the pole with my leg and laying on the ground. Collision was pretty hard and spend some time in the grass waiting for pain to ease. Luckily I hit the pole with calf muscle and not the bone, as I think that impact would be enough to break bones.</p> <p>It’s kinda weird by actually enjoyed that time on the ground realizing what just happened and waiting for paint to go away. Eventually it did go away, but only for some periods of time, and after sitting at home for short period of time, I could not lean on my right leg. Now it seems to get better, and paint is no longer that bad. I enjoyed the whole experience and regret absolutely nothing :)</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-07-11 10:27 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I’m on my way to Katowice.

It was pretty cold outside and generally I was not in the mood. I hate the fact that usually I’m able to do things only when I’m in the mood to do them, but on the other hand, it’s not like I’m ignoring this issues so I don’t thing like feeling guilty will make situation better. Now it is what it is, and I’m slowly tackling thing I feel manageable.</p> <p>For now I’m removing marathon plan from the list of my priorities. It’s definitely something I want to achieve at some point, but now I feel like stabilizing lifestyle I already have is much more important. I’m saying that because it became somewhat hard to stick to habits I’ve already established. Nevertheless it’s nothing bad. If I’ll not demand to much from myself, I think I’ll be able to get into the balance pretty quickly.</p> <p>The other thing I want to talk about is AI and my diary. English is not my first language, so for pretty long time already I’ve been using LLMs to fix grammar mistakes and improve sentence flow. I’m pretty open about that and see nothing bad about doing so. Usually they output text which has the same idea and emotional feeling as the original one, but put in a way that feels easier to read. I was always writing draft which than was feeding to LLM with prompt like “Fix mistakes and improve flow while preserving original style and voice of my following diary record” and then posting the result. However I feel like everything is about to change.</p> <p>I’ve been scrolling reddit and ran into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1luudp3/getting_rejected_by_local_models_must_be_brutal/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" rel="nofollow">post</a> where, probably because of a bug, it gets leaked that company has been using AI to write “A warm but generic job rejections email that sound polite yet firm”. I’m not gonna lie, it pissed me off, as well as a huge portion of other users. But than I thought: “Wait, ain’t I doing it the same way with my diary?“. After some thought I realized that the main cause of frustration (at least for me) is that they tried to pretend like this message was written buy human and not LLM. The attempt to fool me into thinking that they care is what triggered me. I would probably had no such emotion if only they were straight about using AI for writing this mails.</p> <p>But you know what, how random internet user which randomly clicked on my diary can figure out that I’m using LLM to “tweak” my texts. Expecting them to read all the diary until the record where I mention it is ridiculous. On the other side making disclaimer on the page saying that AI was used to improve flow is also somewhat cringy.</p> <p>At the end I decided I’m going to drop AI review all together. Yeah, that means that all the further records including this one are going to be published immediately in “draft” state. There are gonna me a decent amount of grammar errors, misspelling and weird phrasing which might make this diary a bit difficult to read. But as a result it’s gonna become more authentic and transparent. I feel like it’s a good trade-off. On top of that it also gonna be a huge step towards fighting my perfectionism and fear of disappointing others. Like to be absolutely fair, why would I even care about person who cares about mistakes I make and not the ideas I try to express?</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-07-09 15:52 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Finally got my visa renewed, and I feel a bit calmer now :).

I pressure myself to write something outstanding every time. I can’t say this pressure is entirely bad, but it’s made the act of writing more difficult over time. I’ve never kept a diary before this one, but I have a feeling this isn’t the “regular” experience. Perhaps public journaling helps in the same way a private one does, but they must be fundamentally different experiences. Do people with private journals ever play with the idea of someone else reading their entries?</p> <p>I love the idea of sharing. I like the thought of other people enjoying what I put out there, and I enjoy being appreciated. This probably explains why, in recent years, I’ve been so drawn to content creation. It might be overcompensation for things I felt I lacked throughout my life, but I can’t say that’s necessarily a bad thing. Logically, sourcing my happiness externally seems unhealthy, as it means I can’t control the conditions that dictate my own wellbeing.</p> <p>But what’s so special about my wellbeing, anyway? What’s the point of escaping pain? I don’t feel like my emotions are all that important. The next reasonable question, then, is what’s the point of pursuing pleasure? This is a harder question. The same logic doesn’t seem to fit here, because without any emotional stimulus, I wouldn’t find anything worth doing.</p> <p>I guess the point is to neglect spontaneous cravings and any attempts to escape my current state of discomfort, and instead do what I believe is truly important. I feel that dedicating my life to improving the lives of others is the thing that makes the most sense to me. It’s strange, because it sounds like a sacrifice, even though it doesn’t feel like one. It just so happens to be a path that might also fulfill what I want for my own life.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-07-06 15:00 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I spent some time today watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG" rel="nofollow">HealthyGamerGG</a>, specifically his talks with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh518OdBpbI" rel="nofollow">Pokimane</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mwm67Nmiz8" rel="nofollow">Dantes</a>.

LLMs drastically speed up this kind of work. Still, I feel like I’m not using them to their full potential. I’ve been toying with the idea of letting an LLM handle all the changes in the codebase, when I just review and edit what it generates. However, I’m afraid that I’ll get too used to it and my own programming skills might degrade as a result. Maybe it isn’t as bad as my brain is making it out to be. If there’s no need to write code manually anymore, does it really matter if you lose the ability to do it?</p> <p>I enjoy the process, but it’s not immediately clear what makes it so pleasant. What if the act of automating things and solving problems is the cause of that amazing feeling? Then it wouldn’t matter if you can write the code yourself, as long as you’re still able to do everything a person who knows how can. Probably, what turns me on the most is the exploration and creation of new stuff. Finding novel behaviors and patterns within simple, known rules. That desire to deepen my knowledge and understanding of the world will likely persist, no matter how much LLMs automate everything we do.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-07-02 07:08 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[3/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>It’s hard to stay novel and creative all the time.

From now on, I’ll take a picture of myself in the exact same pose, location, and lighting every day. I’ve seen people do this to create a time-lapse that shows how they change over time.

I love Go and it’s a great language, but personally, Zig feels like it’s on another level. I feel like programming has started to bring me more joy than ever before. Instead of thinking about how inconvenient a language design decision is, I’m constantly surprised by how well-thought-out the language I’m using is. Using efficient tools adds a lot of joy to the process and helps get things done faster and better.</p> <p>So obviously, I’ve been programming for most of the day. A good chunk of the tag tool is written, and I made great progress on my terminal game library during my stream. On top of that, I played around with my stream layout, and it’s looking so much more interesting and convenient.</p> <p>However, it wasn’t all rainbows. Today I skipped my morning run and my book reading session. Yesterday evening, I was suddenly hit by a feeling of loneliness. It was really severe, and I couldn’t help myself, so I started watching Twitch just to make it disappear for a moment. As a result, I went to bed after midnight and felt really miserable about it all.</p> <p>But in the end, I don’t really mind. I mean, it’s not ideal, but I can’t do everything perfectly. I don’t accept these failures as unchangeable things I have to live with. Looking at the macro scale, I’m making a great amount of progress in almost all aspects of my life. And on the micro scale… well, shit just happens.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-06-23 07:08 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I’m on the verge of switching to Neovim completely.

I’ve been trying Neovim for a long time, but it never really stuck with me. Still, I didn’t give up on it and kept trying it out. The same was true for Zig. I kept putting off learning it because it felt so overwhelming. Now, it feels almost effortless, and the more I write in it, the more I love it.</p> <p>I’m pretty sure this is all a result of improving my everyday life management. I no longer need to put so much effort into my daily routines and I worry less about the small, unimportant things. As a result, I’m able to focus more deeply on difficult tasks.</p> <p>Another crucial thing is that I’ve become much better at dealing with stress and anxiety.

I’ve simply fallen out of the habit. The problem is that there are so many other, much more saturated sources of information available. Mentally, it’s a lot easier to start checking what’s new on Reddit right after waking up instead of picking up a book. It’s the same problem that has occurred many times before - the same one I’ve written about in my diary quite often. I hate this fear of missing out. I know I could just not check any social media, and in the long run, absolutely nothing would change. Well, actually, it would change for the better, as I’d have more time and desire to do more important things.</p> <p>I can’t rely on my willpower, so I have to engineer my environment to make the wrong thing harder to do than the right one. With social media, however, it’s somewhat difficult, especially taking into account that I’m trying to build my online presence. Recently, I blocked Reddit on my laptop, so now I can only read it on my phone. This segmentation allows me to perceive my PC as purely a workstation, and because of that, it’s much easier to focus on work.</p> <p>Although it was a great change, I still feel like I want more. Ideally, I’d want to just get rid of the urge to do anything distracting. Going cold turkey only helped for a short period, and doing it gradually seems to work a bit better for me. Nevertheless, at some point I’ll feel confident enough to close the remaining gap and fully ditch these dopamine-tapping platforms.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-06-19 20:19 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[3/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I came up with a cool project today. I was meant to be updating my website, specifically the gallery section. It’s unoptimized and could be much more convenient to use. One of the main features that would improve the user experience is a tag system, so every image can have several tags that people can use to sort and group them into albums. I realized that to do this, I’d obviously need to store all the relationships between images and tags somewhere. I decided to do that in a separate file, and after considering JSON, TOML, or a custom format, I settled on JSON.</p> <p>But during that process, I realized what a killer feature this would be for my whole system. Using tags instead of directories could solve a bunch of my file system organization problems. At that moment, I completely switched from updating my website to designing a portable, automatically manageable tag system that would seamlessly integrate into the UNIX ecosystem. It’s actually turned out to be a pretty tough problem, but I think I’ve found a good enough solution that, with some additional tweaking, should work absolutely great.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-06-18 7:46 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I’m in love with Zig.

Zig is filled with small, seemingly unusual design decisions that, it turns out, are intentionally crafted for the best possible programming experience.</p> <p>On a related note, I feel like my streaming skills are starting to pass some threshold. I’m suddenly able to stream for longer periods without feeling tired, and my regular viewer count along with the number of random visitors are starting to climb.

I finally finished a small project I started recently: <a href="https://github.com/axseem/dirmd" rel="nofollow"><code>dirmd</code></a>. It’s a simple tool that merges all the files in a directory into a single markdown file. The idea came to me because I’ve been using LLMs for coding a lot lately and found myself constantly copying and pasting code. It was an inefficient workflow, and I figured I could build something to fix it.</p> <p>I also gave my GitHub profile an update, adding a list of my projects with a clean layout and some amazing pixel art covers I drew myself. I love how it turned out. I have a feeling that having a public list like this (even for small projects) will motivate me to actually finish my projects, especially on days when I’m not feeling like doing so.</p> <p>It’s amazing how much more fulfilled I am at the end of the day when I just do the work and act on my core principles.

A world where anyone can satisfy any desire in an instant. Isn’t that the goal humanity has been moving towards all this time? With recent AI breakthroughs, it suddenly feels achievable.</p> <p>But is a life of nothing but pleasure a good one? Of course, a world without suffering would be incredible. But what then? Do we just continuously tap our dopamine receptors like those mice in the famous experiment? I mean, today’s world is already getting pretty close, with endless entertainment available without any real effort. And it feels like this is just the beginning.</p> <p>Is there any point to a life like that? The question surfaces on its own, but the best answer feels like another question: Is there any point to the life we’re living now? Yeah, it gets complicated fast.</p> <p>Fundamentally, humans are simple creatures. All our actions are just leaves on a tree, and the root is always the same: the need to survive and reproduce. It’s a reasonable conclusion, isn’t it? We evolved according to those rules - that’s simply how natural selection functions.</p> <p>What’s interesting is how such simple rules encourage the formation of complex systems and unpredictable behaviors.

It’s really uncomfortable. I’m always shocked by how close this feeling is to physical discomfort. It literally hurts.</p> <p>This feeling seems so big and unescapable, even though I know tomorrow is probably going to be much better. For some reason, it just happens to me from time to time. I mean, it has been a pretty tough time for me recently, but on some days I can bear it and just keep going, while on others, my mood just falls off a cliff.</p> <p>I hate being overly dramatic for no reason, and because of that, the feeling itself seems unjustified. Like, I can tell that emotionally, I feel absolutely awful right now, but at the same time, there was no pivot point that caused it. As a result, I can’t get rid of this thought that my experience is invalid and I’m “wrong” for feeling this way.</p> <p>The cool thing is that I’m capable of noticing these patterns and finding the reasons behind them, but how automated these patterns are is so frustrating. I can’t just unlock a new reasoning chain and solve the problem. It’s more like I have to just keep living with it for a while, until I accumulate enough experience and knowledge to dismantle them.</p> <p>I’m trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but it still feels like it’s not enough. Like the amount of effort I put into going through everyday life is disproportional to the reward I get out of it. I just feel really tired, and focusing on things I’ve accomplished takes another dose of effort when I’m already running out of stamina.

Or can I?</p> <p>What if I’m living my life wrong? I know there’s no objective “right” or “wrong”, but it feels like this isn’t the life I’m meant to be living. We all have a picture of the life we want, don’t we? Is it fair to myself if I don’t at least try to pursue it? The problem is, when I try to look at my own picture, it’s a blurry, shifting sketch.</p> <p>Living for the future is irrational. It doesn’t exist yet. I can’t base my decisions on something that isn’t real, can I? History has shown that we, as people, are ridiculously bad at predicting long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, we still cling to those predictions as if they were fundamental facts.</p> <p>But living purely in the present is just as confusing. I see what’s happening around me, but I don’t know how to react. Is this what I want? And if it’s not, the only solution is to change my environment - which means investing today for a better tomorrow. And just like that, I’m back to living for the future. I’m trading my present for something I might not even want when I get it, a goal desired by a past version of me.</p> <p>Ultimately, I’m drawn to the result, not the process. But there are no results without heavily investing my time in finding the most efficient processes. Investing in the future seems to be the most common strategy, the one with the highest potential payoff, despite the risk.

I’ve been wondering if I’m doing enough and why I’m still not employed. It feels bad, and the worst part is, it doesn’t help me get any work done either.</p> <p>Actually, I noticed something interesting. While I was on my trip to Budapest, I didn’t have these kinds of thoughts, and it was much easier to do my everyday work.</p> <p>I thought about this for a while and I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ve somehow trained myself to feel overwhelmed. Most likely, because I developed this pattern in this flat, the place itself now acts as a cue for me to start behaving that way. The moment I realized it, I was shocked. The puzzle pieces just clicked into place. This also fits with the fact that I was much more productive in my previous flat.</p> <p>It’s a good thing I noticed, but the next step is more difficult - fixing it. Getting rid of old habits is much harder than forming new ones. Unfortunately, I can’t just move to another place and start fresh. So, I guess the most reasonable thing I can do is to try and change the environment in my current flat. I’ll have to think more about that.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-06-02 06:45 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>It’s raining, and I’m trying to convince myself to go for a run anyway. This also got me thinking again about yesterday’s idea: increasing my distance by 2 km per day. On reflection, that might actually be a bad idea. If I did that, by the end of the third week, I’d be running several almost-marathons back-to-back. I mean, hitting 34, 36, 38, 40, and then 42 km over just five days? That sounds a bit crazy. I’m no professional, but I’m pretty sure I’d need some rest between those kinds of distances.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I’m not giving up on the overall goal.

This vacation was a stark reminder of how emotionally draining it was before I moved out.</p> <p>I see myself as a really peaceful and kind person, but no matter what I talk about with my mom, it quite quickly seems to devolve into abusive, hateful speech. It triggers such a wide spectrum of negative emotions in me.</p> <p>Every time after moments like that, I try to reflect on everything I did and said, and I feel intense regret for my reactions. That just doesn’t sound like me. I don’t normally act that way. It feels like it’s not even me.</p> <p>But on the other hand, I feel like there’s nothing I could say to convert these interactions into pleasant conversations. I don’t want to overblow it or anything, but it genuinely feels like emotional abuse. I just can’t help but stay there, feeling absolutely helpless. It’s really tough in these situations, and it’s also really hard to truly hear the other person when all you can see is hatred and disrespect.</p> <p>It seems like this kind of relationship forces me to act in a way that’s unacceptable by my principles, and it reinforces that kind of behavior. That actually explains why, after moving to Prague, I’ve become a much more pleasant person.</p> <p>I don’t really like to speak about other people this way, especially without them knowing. I always try to be clear about how I feel. But no matter how much I’ve tried, I feel like there’s just no one on the other side to receive the message.</p> <p>Maybe sometimes it’s more beneficial to just give up on certain relationships instead of constantly trying to fix them.</p> <p>I’ve been trying to treat it as a skill issue on my part. I mean, it’s a pretty reasonable thing to consider, as an infinitely great communicator could probably solve any conflict. The problem is, I’m not infinitely great, and no one is. Still, I think I’m generally good enough at communicating with people and solving problems or conflicts. I’m human, and I just can’t make everything perfect. I just can’t mentally treat every ruined relationship as solely my fault. Sometimes, it makes more sense to just forget about them and move on.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-05-30 21:53 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[3/5]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I still feel really weird. I don’t know how to explain it. It doesn’t feel that bad, but it still makes me kind of uncomfortable. In some ways, it reminds me of how frustration feels.

No, that’s probably wrong. Not interpreting discomfort as something bad or something that always has to be fixed seems like a reasonable thing to do, but I can’t neglect what’s causing it. Yeah, sometimes it’s good to accept things as they are and focus on what matters more, but I just can’t help but explore what exactly is happening.</p> <p>I would say it’s my life conditions that frustrate me.

I’ve implemented the new diary page and landed on a good solution for the mood level. All previous records will stay as they are, with the mood level max being 10, while all new records will have a maximum value of 5. I’m kinda afraid I might lose records or data during this refactoring, but luckily, git exists, so in any case, I’ll be able to recover any lost data.</p> <p>Other than that, I feel pretty mid. Kinda calm but also empty. There’s also this strong feeling of lacking intimacy. It’s really hard to understand. I might be wrong, but I feel like I forbid myself to be emotionally weak or vulnerable, even though I really need it. It’s not like it’s hard, but rather I don’t see the point in exposing my feelings to those who won’t accept them anyway. Reading that back, it sounds a bit weirdly phrased.</p> <p>Maybe the point is that I’m just really afraid to be vulnerable, and everything I’m saying is just an attempt to not show my fear? Anyway, I can clearly say I’m like in a fog regarding this question.</p> <p>Do I have trust issues? I was always convinced that I’m a pretty trusting person, and even have a high level of trust for people I don’t know. But now I’m really questioning if that’s true. I mean, there’s a lot of evidence that I am the way I believe I am. This diary is a huge sign of how far I can go with trusting strangers.</p> <p>But on the other hand, it just doesn’t really feel that way. It’s just like nobody really knows about the things I write here. Rationally, I understand that everyone can access everything I write here, but emotionally, I just don’t feel it. It still feels like I’m just writing my thoughts down with only me around to reflect on the written text. Don’t get me wrong, writing this diary is one of the greatest ideas I’ve come up with, but the point is that it just can’t be the evidence of my high trust level.</p> <p>It’s like I can be fully open about everything I feel with any person. Yeah, it’s not easy, but now, considering all the personal improvements I’ve been making, I feel quite confident saying that. I just don’t feel like it helps me. It’s like I’m going to do that for nothing, and because of that, I just lose any motivation. But on the other hand, being vulnerable seems like the best way to find people who will appreciate you the way you are.</p> <p>It seems reasonable to conclude that this feeling comes from the fact that being emotionally open requires some strength and is generally a draining experience, which also has low chances of yielding the desired outcome. But also, if I want to be able to find people I love and people I can be intimate with, I have no other choice but to be absolutely raw and authentic all the time.</p> <p>I have quite a lot of thoughts right now, and quite a lot of them contradict each other. I really want to keep digging into it, but it’s really late, and I feel pretty tired right now. The amount of self-reflection I’m doing is already much greater than I could ever expect from myself. I’m really proud of it and feel like I will find all the answers to my questions. I rarely admit it, but I’m quite happy to be me.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-05-28 22:39 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[8/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I’ve created a new diary page design.

I really enjoyed the trip here. It was a 6-hour bus ride, and I spent most of it listening to music and thinking about everything. For some reason, I had so many interesting thoughts and reasoning chains during this ride. I can recall how profound the experience felt, but unfortunately, I can’t remember everything that was going through my mind. I regret not immediately noting down that stream of thoughts.</p> <p>However, I do remember that one of the topics was human rationality. I noticed that way too often, I try to simulate and predict others’ behavior based on the assumption that people always act rationally. It just happens automatically. But the truth is that we are usually non-deterministic. Quite often we make irrational decisions and simply ignore any common sense. Keeping that in mind could improve my day-to-day decision-making, and also help me not judge other people so harshly.</p> <p>Another cool thing from today was my stream. Yeah, even though I’m far from home, I brought everything I needed and streamed from the apartment here. To be absolutely honest, I’m really proud of myself. Yeah, it all wasn’t actually that hard, but it wouldn’t have been a problem if I’d just skipped one week, especially considering that on average I only have a few viewers on my broadcasts.

I tried it for printing keycaps, and oh man, it’s insanely good! I’m confused why so many people underrate this filament. Yeah, it can warp a bit, but it’s honestly not that bad, and I can’t say it’s much worse than PLA. It’s also about 20% lighter than PLA or PETG, since its density is only ~1g/cm³ compared to their ~1.25g/cm³. And the most shocking thing? The surface quality is outstanding. That’s already a remarkable set of traits, but on top of that, it’s pretty tough and has great UV resistance. Now I regret ordering those five rolls of PLA and PETG filament before testing this other popular one.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-05-14 19:37 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[7/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Writing this record just after the conference with an engineering manager.

Among all the things that tumbled down were my Truthear Hexa IEMs.</p> <p>A long time ago, I had cleaned them using isopropanol, and as a result, the left driver started crackling at high volume levels. I was really upset about that, as I loved their sound so much. I was also kinda confused, as I was sure that IPA couldn’t cause them any harm. Obviously, I left them to dry for a few days, but unfortunately, that crackling sound never went away. I ended up ordering and switching to the more budget-friendly Truthear Gates.</p> <p>Now, for some reason, I became really curious to test them out once again. And oh gosh… they worked! Not only was there no crackling sound, but after exclusively using budget IEMs for a while, these sounded absolutely astonishing.</p> <p>I was extremely happy about that. I checked, and a new pair would cost me about $80. It felt almost like I’d received an unexpected gift.</p> <p>As a result, I spent the whole day listening to music. I went through a huge chunk of my main playlist, after which I started looking for old songs I used to listen to. I’m seriously overflowing with this feeling of nostalgia.

Waking up that late makes the day feel so short, and trying to compensate for it only makes things worse, because then you just wake up later the next day.

Gridfinity is a great standard, as it has a huge amount of compatible models, however, I don’t really like its static nature. It seems perfect for drawers, but not shelves. Luckily, I found a bunch of Rugged Box designs with Gridfinity slots inside. That’s actually a genius concept. Nevertheless, I don’t really like the designs I found, as there are a lot of subtle things I’d like to be different. Because of that, I’ll probably design my own.

It’s not like I have a lot to say, either, since not much has really changed.

However, nothing went as I expected. I barely managed to do any work because I just didn’t feel like doing it. I was constantly looking for ways to distract myself.</p> <p>My stream didn’t go well either. I decided to download League of Legends and play it on stream. I used to play it a lot, but I dropped the game completely about two years ago. Now I clearly remember why. It’s not that the game itself is bad, or that the gameplay wasn’t satisfying. There was this constant feeling deep inside me that I was wasting my time. Even though I could push that feeling away for periods, it never really stopped haunting me. And honestly, that feeling is completely justified, as I really do get nothing out of playing it except wasted time.</p> <p>I know I clearly lack deep relationships right now, but it’s also clear that this isn’t something that gets fixed in a week or even a month. I also understand that I have a lot of responsibilities and countless tasks I have to prioritize. They seem never-ending.</p> <p>Solving my problems one by one, finding new ways to do things better, and managing not to go crazy no longer feels like a great achievement, but more like the baseline requirement just to survive.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-05-02 23:16 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[7/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I was expecting my new roommate to arrive today, but it didn’t happen.

There’s still a lot of room to optimize the available time during the day, but I already rarely doom-scroll Reddit or YouTube. And when I do, I’ve started to quickly recognize it and immediately correct course.</p> <p>However, I still struggle with sticking to my good habits. The most obvious one is sleep. For the last week, or perhaps even two, I’ve been falling asleep later than my scheduled time. That’s something I believe is the most worthwhile thing to fix, as it potentially influences my performance and mood during all my other activities.</p> <p>But it’s not just sleep. This entry is a good example of that. I used to write in my diary first thing in the morning, but now I’m doing it late in the evening.</p> <p>What’s even worse, yesterday I completely forgot to take my daily selfie and only remembered in the middle of the night. I can clearly recall the realization that I’d lost the streak hitting me, right before that awful feeling of losing everything you’ve been working on for so long. Luckily, after checking the clock, it was 23:59:30. I managed to quickly get up, turn on the light, and snap an awkward, rushed picture. Just seconds before midnight, I managed to save the streak of 82 days.</p> <p>It was actually a pretty stressful experience. Like, it seems to be just a minor thing, so what’s the reason to be so stressed out about it? But after thinking about the situation, I came to the realization that it’s not really about having a one-day gap in my gallery of daily photos, but rather about losing the proof of being the person I want to be.</p> <p>All those little challenges and semi-important habits are really just a way to prove to myself that I’m the kind of guy I want to be. To prove to myself that I’m constantly growing and absolutely not okay with falling behind. Basically, it’s part of my identity, the image I hold of myself, my marker on the map towards becoming a better version of myself.</p> <p>I’m afraid of getting lost. Life is often foggy, and it’s hard to have a clear picture of where you’re heading. I’ve already experienced this, and I know that no matter how lost I am, I’ll always look for the path and eventually find it. Nevertheless, it’s just much easier not to get off that path in the first place, so I don’t have to look for it later.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-04-29 17:21 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[7/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Today, I spent the morning cleaning my flat.

I’m going to visit my old friend Artem, as it’s his birthday today. He mentioned he doesn’t really want anything specific for a gift and wouldn’t mind if I didn’t bring one, or if it was just something small.</p> <p>My original plan was to gift him a keychain with a small MX key switch - it’s cute and doubles as a great little fidget toy. However, yesterday I got another, maybe better, idea: I could 3D print a pocket chess set for him! “What a great idea,” I thought, and got to work around midday.</p> <p>Fast forward to midnight, and all I had to show for my efforts were several warped, layer-shifted, and broken pieces of plastic. I’d never tried multicolour printing before, and it turns out there are a lot of caveats. Or perhaps it’s just really easy to mess things up on a machine not specifically designed for it.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I had absolutely no desire to give up, even though I knew I needed to wake up at 5:30 AM. By half past one this morning, I finally managed to get a working board printed. It’s not perfect - it definitely has some visual defects - but it works, and that felt like the most important thing.

Yeah, yesterday I discovered I can print keycaps for keyboards! After playing around with slicer settings and printing orientation, they’re turning out to be really good quality. I’d often heard that FDM printers weren’t suitable for such small and detailed prints, but it seems they’re actually good enough. Self-made keycaps also happen to be much cheaper than store-bought ones and grant an incredible level of customization.</p> <p>I guess that’s a solid plan for today, but if there’s time left, I’ll look into the process of declaring self-employment.

I won’t lie, it still feels like I could be doing much more, but it’s progress, and that’s what matters. I generally tend to have a negative attitude, and that causes more harm than good. Recognizing my progress is crucial for improving.</p> <p>Yesterday, I ordered <code>AOC Q27B3CF2</code> monitor for $230 and brought it home today. It’s big - 27 inches, to be exact - with 1440p resolution. I’ve wanted a good monitor for a long time. I spend a huge amount of time on my PC, so improving the experience seems reasonable (that’s the same reason I got into the ergonomic keyboard hobby, btw). Such a huge usable area should drastically increase comfort during programming, as it can fit much more code on screen at once, and thus make the job more enjoyable. Technically, it’s an investment in my working environment meant to increase my efficiency, yet I feel kinda conflicted about the decision. Buying anything that expensive without a stable income just makes me feel bad and doubt if it was even rational.</p> <p>Recently, I’ve really been thinking about this. The main problem isn’t that I spend money, but that I don’t earn it. Isn’t it? Like, I don’t throw money around, and I think through any purchase thoroughly. Spending less won’t create a positive monthly income, and not having one is the main problem. It’s much better to focus my time on trying to earn money rather than just trying to save it. Yeah, I think that’s a good way to put it.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-04-21 21:08 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[6/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>3D printing is such a cool thing. The more I play with it, the more unique ways I find to practically use it. I’d even say it’s too great. I’m literally doing almost nothing but looking through online models, designing my own, and printing them.</p> <p>It’s kind of funny, but this hyperfocus means there are much more important things I’m not doing. Perhaps the most important is tackling my unemployment. I still haven’t applied for self-employment, nor have I been programming or searching for open vacancies.</p> <p>To be honest, I’ve been pretty messy lately. I can’t really pin down why. Yeah, as I mentioned before, it’s kind of a tough period for me, and I often feel really isolated. However, that’s not an excuse. I’m seriously addicted to any kind of short-term pleasure and keep choosing cheap dopamine over meaningful work. It’s really upsetting.</p> <p>The great thing is I can recognize this. Now, I just need to start working on it. I’ve noticed that setting a specific start time never works for me; I always postpone it and never actually begin what I planned. That’s why I’m going to try and start everything I’ve been putting off immediately, including fixing my sleep schedule. I need to constantly ask myself if what I’m doing at any given moment really matters in the long term.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-04-20 12:02 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[8/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Fell asleep at 3 AM last night - that’s a record!

My diary has definitely been helping me a lot with that. However, I still feel like my journaling process could be better. For instance, I often want to write things down during the day, not wait until the next morning. Having each day in a separate file also feels suboptimal. And while the mood scale is a cool idea in theory, my mood often jumps around so much during the day that a single rating feels inaccurate and hard to compare meaningfully across days.</p> <p>These thoughts are feeding into a bigger plan: I want to redesign my website, taking these journaling limitations and a lot more into account. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting this whole thing to go that far. But before I can really dive into the website project, I need to migrate my main setup from Linux to macOS.</p> <p>I’m doing this reluctantly. I much prefer Linux, especially NixOS which adds incredible reliability and reproducibility to the mix, offering limitless possibilities. But running Linux on closed hardware like a MacBook introduces too many trade-offs at this point. In recent days alone, I’ve run into trouble with essential software like OBS Studio, Orca Slicer, and FreeCAD. Beyond specific apps, there are persistent quirks like broken display scaling, the absence of hardware video decoding/encoding, and no DisplayPort support to connect an external monitor properly.</p> <p>Ideally, I’d buy a laptop with a much more open approach (like a Framework Laptop), but I’m too broke for that right now. Besides, that would probably come with its own trade-offs, like shorter battery life or a worse color accuracy. Apple Silicon MacBooks are great machines; my only real problem with them is the closed nature of the company and the lock-in ecosystem. But I guess, for me, there just isn’t a better practical option right now.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-04-17 23:05 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[4/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Yesterday was awful. I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown. That feeling came on kind of spontaneously and was pretty intense. There are just way too many problems. Loneliness is the biggest one. I had an urge to cry out, but I quickly realized that there aren’t any people around me I would want to do that turn to. I really can’t understand it. It feels like the problem is me, but is it really? Is it okay that I don’t have friends I would want to be with during such a difficult time?</p> <p>It’s hard for me to like people, but I don’t hate them either. I’m really a peaceful and kind person, and I almost never stay angry or hold a grudge against anyone. I’m just not interested. The thing is, I really want to be, but I’m just not. Why is it that way? Am I doing something wrong? Those are the questions that always follow me.</p> <p>I wish I could try therapy, but I can’t afford it. Luckily, I live in a time when progress is faster than ever. It was hard keeping all these feelings inside, so I decided to chat with an LLM, specifically <code>Gemini 2.5 Pro</code>. It always feels kind of weird, but it works well enough. I even saw a paper suggesting that people sometimes prefer answers from AI over human therapists, as AI text can apparently seem more empathetic. It helped me feel a bit better and see things a bit clearer, but it’s still tough.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-04-16 07:24 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[8/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>The 3D printer arrived yesterday.

I know I can easily build habits just by adjusting my environment, but for some reason, I’ve stopped using this trick. It might be one of the easiest and most efficient ways to form a habit, at least in my experience. Instead, way too often, I foolishly rely solely on my willpower. Then, after inevitably failing to resist, I blame myself for being weak. This pattern often happens almost unconsciously, but recognizing it makes it clear: that’s the bad habit. Acknowledging it is a great first step toward change.

It was a great day. I managed to get a lot done while still relaxing properly. In the morning, right after the gym, my friend Artem suggested renting bicycles and riding around. I haven’t ridden a bicycle for a while now, so I obviously agreed. We had a lot of fun. I’d already forgotten how nice such a little thing as riding a bike could feel.</p> <p>Today, I finished the PCB and did it live on Twitch. I’ve decided to keep a strict streaming schedule: every day at 4 p.m. for at least two hours. The most interesting thing is that I wasn’t sitting alone. There was one viewer who watched the progress from start to finish. I streamed for 4 hours, and somewhere after the first hour, he wrote in the chat, and we started chatting.</p> <p>Damn, I really struggle to speak fluently. It’s already a kinda weird experience talking to a camera, and doing it in English makes it even harder. Clearly, I lack the regular practice needed to recall words immediately and not think about grammar. Nevertheless, I greatly enjoyed it. The person who watched and chatted with me told me how he found me: he saw me on the r/ErgoMechKeyboards subreddit, then found my website. There, he’d been reading my public diary, saw the entry where I wrote about deciding to start streaming, and that’s how he found my Twitch. To say I was impressed is to say nothing. I wasn’t expecting anyone to be interested in my diary, let alone join my stream because of it. He said a lot of kind words, and I was really pleased to hear them.</p> <p>It seems so small, but it still grants wonderful emotions. I understand that this person might just lose interest in what I’m doing and forget about me in just a few days. However, I’m ok with that. I knew I wasn’t going to have many viewers - not even a small, consistent number - for a long time. I’m ready to go live and sit alone, as I basically lose nothing. I can share my work, improve my communication and English skills, have a great time, and get the chance to chat with cool people once in a while. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting it to be such a potentially self-improving hobby. Now I’ve tasted it, and it seems like something I might be ready to do full time. Yeah, I might be a bit delusional, but who knows how it will turn out.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-03-30 20:23 +0200</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[8/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Yesterday, I had a fascinating idea. Every day, I spend a lot of time creating something interesting on my laptop. So, I thought, why wouldn’t I stream everything I do? In fact, that’s a great question. Yeah, streaming is a high-competitive field, and it’s not easy to get into. But the point is that I don’t have to put a lot of effort into it; I just do the same things I always do, but now also stream them on Twitch. I lose nothing and get a chance to grow a community. It couldn’t be better.</p> <p>I decided not to put off this idea. Right after waking up, I started configuring everything I needed to start streaming. Although it wasn’t perfect, it was good enough for the first time. Somewhere in the evening, I launched my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2419377280" rel="nofollow">first broadcast</a>. There was nothing crazy. I was just designing the PCB for the keyboard. I was live for a little more than 2 hours, and it was a great experience. Even though it was harder than I originally expected, I liked the process. Also, as a huge bonus, you really can’t get distracted from the job, which drastically increased my productivity.</p> <p>Getting even a small number of viewers is gonna be tough, but I see no reason not to try. I plan on streaming pretty much every day when I have free time. It’s an exciting, new experience for me, and I believe in the long run it will pay off.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-03-29 19:49 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[7/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Today was a good day.

I managed to stay productive for pretty much the whole day and, as a result, got a lot done.</p> <p>I also ate almost nothing today. I’d run out of chicken and apples, so I decided to eat lightly and buy groceries in the evening. All I had were two sandwiches and a few peanuts. Nevertheless, I feel absolutely great - probably even better than usual. I just got back from the supermarket. Unfortunately, there was no chicken breast, so I bought ham instead, along with several apples. It become hard to live without fruits :).</p> <p>There’s still an intense feeling of loneliness. However, I somehow manage to ignore it. Can’t tell if it’s a good approach, but at least it helps me stay in the moment for periods of time. Actually, I hardly see any viable option to fix that problem - at least, not quickly. However, something tells me that’s okay.

I have this feeling that there’s no one among the people I know who could truly make me feel better. I realize that it’s okay, and this has happened to me many times before. Even though knowing that makes it a bit easier to handle, it still feels awful.</p> <p>Actually, I’m not wrong about the lack of close people in my life. Generally, I feel like I’m losing ground in both the quality and quantity of my relationships. Honestly, that’s kinda weird to me, because it turns out I am a good person - better than I ever thought. I’m always kind to people, I stay calm in conflicts, I try to be as sincere as I can, and I do not stop looking for ways to become even better. It often seems like I’m much more willing to support and improve relationships than the other person involved. I can’t tell if it’s just bad luck or if I’m doing something wrong.</p> <p>Also, I’m not doing great regarding my lifestyle. For hours, I scroll Instagram and YouTube, play chess, read Reddit, and do other meaningless things. I’ve written about this before, but it’s much harder to stay on the right path when you feel down. What’s even worse, it’s both the cause and the result of me feeling so devastated.</p> <p>Clearly, it’s not all negative. I keep growing in every aspect of my life. I’ve noticed how much I take for granted all the improvements I’ve made as a person, which weren’t even there not long ago. Sometimes focusing on the positive aspects is really hard.

It’s often overwhelming, but I guess it has to be this way. I like making progress in all aspects of my life, and the only way to achieve that is to keep growing.

I still want to move to another country, but it seems like now is not a great time to do that. Comparing all the pros and cons, I concluded that there are many more trade-offs than I originally expected. I won’t lie, I’m a bit upset about that, but there are also things that make me feel better about it. I can try to fully invest myself in creating a custom keyboard shop, as I don’t have to worry that I’ll have to move and have a big setback. I’m actually pretty thrilled about this idea. I need to get all the documents for it done ASAP, and give it a try.</p> <p>Also, I’ve decided to remove titles and summaries from diary entries. They are just way too overwhelming considering I’m writing an entry per day. I have an idea for a new diary page design, in the form of a calendar. The number of entries is accumulating so fast, having them in one huge scrolling feed seems increasingly unreasonable. All new entries will be written without titles, while older ones will preserve them in the markdown files, but they will not be shown on the website.</p> <p>I have a lot of stuff to do, but most of the time I procrastinate instead of doing it. That’s a problem, but I’m working on it every day, so it will eventually be solved. Reminding myself how fulfilling those deep and meaningful activities are helps a lot in getting back to them. Also, I’ve noticed that forcing myself to do something always leads to less effectiveness and more frustration. The great approach is to not force yourself to do something useful, but rather forbid useless activities. That way you only deal with one problem - an urge to do something meaningless, rather than also trying to stay focused on something you have to do. Sooner or later, the brain becomes bored and suddenly, even difficult activities seem much more appealing.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-03-23 10:36 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[5/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I’ve noticed that lately I’ve been writing much less in this diary. I’ve been leaving out so many things I’m thinking and worrying about, sometimes just because I’m afraid of what others might think if they read it. Which is ironic, because I started a public diary to break free from that fear in the first place. I want to be raw, no matter what others say or think.</p> <p>But I’m still unsure what can I share publicly, and what shouldn’t I? “Share anything that doesn’t raise safety concerns” seems like an obvious answer. Yet when I really think about it, almost any personal information can be weaponized - it’s just a matter of degree. I don’t feel unsafe, but it still seems right to stay cautious even without an immediate threat. For now, I’m okay publishing nearly everything about myself, but not details involving people I know without their agreement.

To say I was impressed would be an understatement. I didn’t even realize just how quickly three hours had flown by. The insights in our dialogue were surprisingly profound. Gemini’s tone felt warm and almost <em>genuine</em> - a striking contrast to the AI interaction I was used to. It’s clear this technology holds immense potential. I’d always viewed AI as a tool for narrow tasks, but now I see it’s better approached as a broadly applicable multi-tool. This mindset unlocks creativity by pulling the mind out of rigid patterns, opening the way for truly unique solutions.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-03-12 13:15 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[8/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>So far, I’m doing great. It’s still hard to stay productive for long periods of time; however, I’m managing to avoid giving in to my urges without too much effort. Yesterday, I came up with a cool addition to my diary: every day, I’ll rate my mood on a scale from 1 to 10. Over time, this data will accumulate, letting me build statistics and uncover hidden correlations or patterns. How cool is that? From now on, every entry will include a colorful <code>mood</code> indicator to show my mindset at the time of writing.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-03-11 20:29 +0100</span> <!--[--><span>mood:[7/10]</span><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>It happened again. I put off writing in my diary all day, only to speedrun it in the evening. Honestly, I’m way too forgiving with myself. I ignored the “opt-out” rule I set on Sunday, and as a result, I lost a big chunk of today’s time. I’m really tired of this lifestyle. Tomorrow <em>will</em> be different, I promise.</p> <p>Yesterday, I shipped another keyboard, this time to California. It’s such a joy to realize people use and enjoy something you’ve created. I’ll be brave enough to say that it’s probably one of the greatest feelings ever. It gives you a really deep sense of purpose and the motivation to keep going.</p> <p>The day before yesterday, I had a fascinating idea. I combined my entire diary into one file and fed it to several LLMs. I asked them to analyze it deeply and give me some ideas, patterns, blind spots, tips, and so on. Honestly, I was shocked by the results. I wasn’t expecting to get so many insights. I tried it with <code>Deepseek R1</code> and <code>Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking</code>. Both performed impressively, but Gemini’s response felt warmer and had a certain “humanity” to it, to the point where I even felt a bit uncomfortable. It’s just so weird to observe such good understanding and support, to the degree that it seems like the person knows me better than I do, and then remembering that the write-up was generated by a big word prediction algorithm. What an insane time we’re living in.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-03-10 22:40 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Currently it is 21:40.

It is an unusual experience to say the least. We’ve been thinking about the previous sentence for around 2 minutes. Kinda funny considering it’s only 9 words. I’m really glad to be on the call with her and feel absolutely no guilt for skipping my regular bedtime.</p> <p>Quite rarely do I have an opportunity to have such deep conversations.

Recently I’ve tried to grind the meat instead of chopping it. It takes much less time and additionally meat doesn’t get stuck in the teeth, which is a huge benefit. So… I began grinding the meat in my blender. Somewhere in the middle of the process the least expected thing happened. My blender fired! Its handle sparkled for a moment accompanied by a zap sound. Almost immediately, smoke started coming out of it. It was absolutely cooked. Apparently, I’d been grinding for way too long :)</p> <p>Although I was kinda upset, nothing bad happened.

It’s a great time to learn to be unconditionally optimistic. And actually, it’s not even that hard. The only thing that makes it hard is telling yourself it’s hard. Just believe you can do anything, and that’s it. It’s clear that pure optimism alone can lead to big positive changes in how you act.</p> <p>Recently, I came to the conclusion that increasing general intelligence is a great solution to almost any complex problem. In fact, you often can’t solve a problem because you aren’t smart enough in the first place. And when I say general intelligence, I literally mean everything. Having good reasoning skills, knowing various facts, being able to quickly understand situations, and not acting on emotions - all of this is part of intelligence. I could pretend that the way to achieve it is complex and requires a lot of effort, like I often do. But there are no secret tricks, just do what is generally known to be good for you: Read books, talk to people, think about complex topics, don’t waste your time on meaningless activities, and spend your free time actively.</p> <p>I love reading books. It’s played a huge role in making me who I am today. I have a habit of reading every day for at least 30 minutes. This morning I thought, why not increase my daily goal, given how much I benefit and enjoy books? I set a new goal of 2 hours of reading per day. The idea of becoming better four times faster sounds insanely cool. Today was the first day, and even though I was a bit afraid, but in fact, it was an absolutely amazing experience. The sense of purpose adds additional pleasure to the process. It turns out everything becomes much easier the moment you stop complaining and looking for reasons why you can’t do it.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-02-21 07:37 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>The future is dim, yet it seems to be extremely close.

By jumping ahead and trying to get the most polished result possible on the first try, you risk wasting your time on a possibly weak idea. The number one priority is to get the idea going as soon as possible. That way you’ll make sure you’ve worked through all aspects and gathered feedback that will let you know if your vision is any good. Once you see the big picture and understand the whole process, it will be much easier to refine the product.</p> <p>This is nothing new or extraordinary, and yet I always forget to follow these principles. Not everything matters. In fact, most things don’t matter, and you should make sure you spend your time on those that do matter. With all the options we have in today’s oversaturated world, it’s pretty easy to lose track of what is truly worth your time and effort. However, the same environment allows anyone who is not afraid of difficulties to achieve unimaginable results.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-02-17 07:47 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>It’s noticeable how I improve every day, yet I still wish I were doing more. I’m really enjoying the gym lately. About two months ago, I had the idea to try working out at a gym instead of at home. I wasn’t expecting it to be such a pleasant experience, I’d even call it addictive. Currently, I only work out on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, but I’m thinking I should start going every day. Recently, it’s become clear that on days when I don’t visit the gym in the morning, I’m far less productive, even though there’s theoretically more time for work.</p> <p>Paradoxically, doing more things grants more time and the possibility to do even more things. Sometimes I wonder if we need rest as much as everyone says we do. Most of the time, I feel absolutely no deprivation after long periods of deep work. However, the moment of contrast getting into work right after resting feels like torture. It seems like splitting time into chunks of work and rest is actually more harmful than helpful. At least for me, a better approach is to look for activities that fulfill you, don’t tire you, and allow to be productive at the same time. There’s no point in doing what you don’t like, whatsoever.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-02-16 09:48 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Time flies way too fast. I’m always short on time. Obviously, the main cause is that I don’t manage it properly. Each day I waste at least 2 hours that I could spend producing something valuable. That’s a hell of a lot lost, and I can’t afford it. Being productive all the time is just a regular habit, like everything else. I have to embrace it and intensively keep forming that habit. I need to get used to constantly ask myself if what I’m doing throughout the day really matters.</p> <p>The world is rapidly changing, and there is no time to hesitate. I want to always be in the front line, and to achieve that, I have to adapt quickly. There is no point in investing time in narrow skills anymore. Considering the progress that LLMs have made in recent years, all the hard skills will be automated soon enough. Now, being able to see the wider picture is much more important. In the near future, general intelligence paired with fast adaptation will probably be the most crucial factors for personal success. And even if I’m wrong, improving those skills will pay off anyway, as they are pretty valuable even in today’s world.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-02-15 02:29 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>It’s 02:30 in the morning.

We are living in such a fascinating time, when anyone can learn anything, all they need is a strong desire.

I already did a diary entry today, but I can’t resist beginning another one.</p> <p>Today was an unusually great day. My roommate invited me to a picnic with his university friends. Obviously, I agreed. It sounded like a great chance to meet new people and to practice my English at the same time. What’s the worst that could happen?</p> <p>We came to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hJJqK3zDwH4iQ8ku7" rel="nofollow">Letná Park</a> in the afternoon. There were already a bunch of people at the beginning, but even more were coming. All of them were from different countries, and every one of them was such a pleasure to talk to. But at some point, the unexpected happened.</p> <p>New people came, and Georgia was among them. I was absolutely stunned by how pretty she was. When I first saw her eyes, I couldn’t help but stare at them.</p> <p>Naturally, I wanted to get to know her better, so I was going to talk to her, when almost immediately, I was stopped. The fear inside of me began to rapidly eat me alive. I felt shackled, unable to do anything about it.</p> <p>I urgently wanted to distract myself or do something, anything but what I actually wanted. I kept talking with people, trying to get rid of the crushing sense of dread that followed me. It felt so wrong, yet I felt so helpless.</p> <p>After a short time, I was talking to her friend. We were discussing how peculiar human languages are, how drastically they differ, and what a great impact they have on us as a society. The topic was extremely appealing to me, so the conversation was really engaging.</p> <p>Not long afterwards, Georgia joined the discussion. She didn’t talk much, but when she did, she seemed so intelligent, and it was so attractive. I still can’t tell if I was just blinded by how gorgeous she was. During the conversation, I learned that she was here for a few days and would be leaving back to Italy soon.</p> <p>Towards evening, I had to leave. Everything was coming to an end, and we were packing everything up. By then, I had still hardly spoken to her at all, which made me feel extremely silly. At some point, I got so overwhelmed by the fact that fear runs my life and I do nothing about it. It became clear that I had no choice but to act.</p> <p>“You know, it can be kinda unusual, but I think you are really cute.” Something like that is what I barely managed to tell her. I was expecting nothing. It just felt right to tell her how I felt. Being sincere is really important to me, and I simply couldn’t let fear get in my way.</p> <p>She got embarrassed and said something like, “Thanks, you’re cute too.” There are no words that can describe how happy and baffled I was. After such a great introduction, what could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>I froze instantly. No matter how hard I tried, the words wouldn’t come out of my mouth. There was just silence and an awkward tension building up. Explaining how embarrassed I was is all I managed to do, after which the conversation ended quickly.</p> <p>Now that I’m reflecting on it, it’s hard to describe the way I feel. I’m glad that in spite of all the odds, I overcame my anxiety, and yet I can’t stop thinking about how awkward my behavior was. I feel so guilty, as she probably expected more than what I did. I didn’t even ask her for any contact or give her mine. How can success be so close and yet so far away?</p> <p>I would love to meet her again, but unfortunately, it seems like moving on is the only real option I have.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-02-11 07:17 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I need a project. Something that I can potentially grow into a startup, or at least learn something from.</p> <p>Recently, I came up with an interesting idea. The plan is to build a social platform for book reading. It will allow users to easily discover what they would like to read, find out what other people are currently into, and see what authors think about other books. The platform will promote small writers and prioritize quality content. Additionally, I would like to integrate a cross-platform reader and be able to host popular books and articles right on the website, all of which will be available to read via a monthly subscription.</p> <p>Seems like a potentially good concept. It could fill a nice niche, as not a lot of people are reading these days, and it has a chance to turn into a bigger project, considering the growing trend of conscious content consumption and self-improvement. Also, it is a fully digital project (unlike my previous one), which means it will be much easier for people to try it, making it easier to gain public awareness.</p> <p>And last but not least, I would personally want to use such an app. I love reading, and recently have been spending a lot of time with it, but the user experience is far behind compared to other popular forms of content.

Hence, I’m ready to <strong>face the awkwardness and discomfort</strong>, striving to the greater goal.</p> <p><em>You can’t grow rapidly without failing frequently.</em></p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-02-03 20:42 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I can’t see what I’m going to do in three months. It feels like <strong>I’m walking in the fog</strong>.</p> <p>There are so many things I love doing and would happily devote myself to. But <strong>liking something isn’t enough</strong> - there’s another critical factor: money. <strong>Just to exist already requires decent income</strong> (rent alone is brutally expensive). <em>And who only wants to exist?</em> <strong>Everyone wants to live fully</strong> - to grow, to feel alive, to explore new places and ideas.</p> <p><strong>The thought of working in an office</strong> for eight hours a day <strong>kills me</strong>. <strong>I crave deep work</strong> and will gladly lose myself in projects for hours, <strong>but money alone can’t motivate me for too long</strong>. Work without any purpose quickly becomes meaningless.</p> <p>I need to find a way to sustain myself while being able to <strong>explore different fields and aspects of life</strong>. <em>Turns out making money on your own is not that easy. Or is it?</em> The thing is, <strong>I probably overestimate the difficulty</strong>, and being afraid of failing, I simply choose to do nothing.</p> <p>Yet in this time of uncertainty, <strong>there is no room for waiting</strong>. The best thing I can do is to plan less and <strong>try more</strong>. Preparing has its value, but it’s so easy to accidentally trap yourself in an infinite loop. There are a lot of things you simply cannot predict without getting halfway through, and at that point <strong>obsessive planning won’t help you</strong>.</p> <p>It’s ideal time to <strong>stop complaining</strong> and <strong>start acting</strong>.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-02-02 21:03 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Okay, so another day writing a diary. <strong>I’m pretty happy</strong> with how everything’s going. The progress over the past few days has is already noticeable, and <strong>becoming hyper self-aware made a huge difference</strong>.</p> <p>I’ve been thinking about this diary recently, and I’ll probably have to change how I do it. First of all, after posting my diary publicly, I’ve noticed that <strong>I’ve started to overthink and filter</strong> everything I write. That’s not great, but <strong>continuing to share</strong> everything openly might <strong>eventually fix the problem</strong> over time.</p> <p>There’s one important question I struggle to answer though. <em>How much does it matter that someone is reading what you write?</em> The problem is that <strong>I’m highly addicted to the attention</strong>. No matter what I do, if I’m the only one who knows about it, I quickly lose interest. It’s not ideal. There are always periods when <strong>you have to grind</strong> without having any quick results, and <strong>patience</strong> in those moments <strong>is the key</strong>.</p> <p>Clearly, my writing is <strong>far from being valuable</strong> to others, <strong>but</strong> the only way to improve is to <strong>keep writing</strong>.</p> <p>All my previous posts were shared on my Instagram stories so my friends would notice. That way, I tried to create at least some <strong>illusion of importance</strong> around what I’m doing, but it’s probably <strong>not a healthy habit</strong>. Because of that, I’ll likely <strong>stop reposting everything</strong> on social media and <strong>only share my best work</strong>. Those who care about everything I write will find new post on my website on their own anyway.</p> <p>Finally, I plan to <strong>rebuild the website</strong> from the ground up. I want to make it more <strong>structured, cleaner, and easier to use</strong>. The key features I want to add are separate pages for blog and diary, plus an option to opt-in for <strong>notifications</strong> about new posts.</p> <p>So far it seems like I’m moving in the right direction. Everything else is pretty simple - just <strong>do not stop grinding</strong>.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-02-01 21:42 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Now it’s 20:16, Saturday. I’m sitting at my desk typing this text on my laptop. I should have done it earlier as I have to go to sleep soon.</p> <p>I lack discipline. Often, the wrong thing is so much easier to do. By the end of the day, I’ve done nothing in particular. I was learning useless information (like which LLM that could be run on my laptop is gonna be the best) and watching YouTube videos.</p> <p>It’s hard to think or concentrate. There are so many bad habits I have to rid myself of. My mind is a mess and shouldn’t be this way.</p> <p>My lifestyle is getting really close to that of an average person, and it feels unnervingly wrong. There’s no deep mental work, each day is just a bunch of small, easy, unrelated things that together create a comfortable existence. It’s almost like sitting in a boat, passively drifting along with the current. Why would anyone choose this?</p> <p>Life is weird. Why do we even exist? How do you know if there’s a reason to do something? Obviously, humanity has questioned this long before me. Every person has to find their own meaning to live, but how?</p> <p>A popular opinion is that you should live for yourself. You only get one life, so you have to enjoy it while you can. This sounds reasonable but doesn’t quite “click” for me. My life just doesn’t seem important enough to invest all my effort into. Eventually, I’ll die, and it’ll be impossible to look back on how pleasant the life was.</p> <p>Curiosity might be my strongest motivator. Emotions often give meaning to our actions, even though they have no meaning by themselves.</p> <p>It’s always been kinda funny to reflect on these things, but I think there’s no point in reflecting on it for too long. We are indeed driven by emotions which are nothing more than the product of coincidence, but that’s just the way world is.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-01-31 21:37 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>Finally, I’m writing a diary not only when I feel down.</p> <p>Yesterday was hard. I was desperate, but I’m so much better now. Publishing my writeup was one of the best decisions I’ve made in a long time.</p> <p>A lot of people have written to me after, cheering me up and sharing their thoughts. Even though that’s probably what I wanted, it’s definitely not what I was expecting. The most surprising was the amount of unique ways people were reacting. It was so fascinating to see how different each person was, yet had no trouble finding common ground.</p> <p>Although I feel much clearer now, the way my mood has changed in just one day scares me a little. Emotions are good at pointing out when something is wrong, but as it turns out, they can also lead you in the wrong directions. Nevertheless, hitting rock bottom definitely made me more aware of my state.</p> <p>I was way too dramatic questioning if I’m doing everything right. There is plenty of evidence that I am moving in the right direction, so it is pointless to spend a lot of time doubting that. Things don’t always work out, and that’s okay - just don’t stop looking for better approaches.</p> <p>And to sum up, I am so happy to be surrounded by friends with so many different worldviews and opinions that I can learn from. I can’t express just how grateful I am to everyone &lt;3.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----> <section class="flex flex-col min-w-0 pt-8 pb-3 lg:pb-11 lg:pt-16 border-t border-outline -mx-8 md:-mx-12 lg:-mx-16"><div class="px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-16"><div class="flex justify-between font-mono text-onsurface-var mb-4"><span>2025-01-30 20:55 +0100</span> <!--[!--><!--]--></div> <div class="min-w-0"><p>I feel bad, and as always, I write my diary only when I feel bad. I promised myself to write everyday. It didn’t last even a week. I promised not to use social media and other distractions. Nevertheless, the very next day I ignored that promise.</p> <p>My life is bad. It seems like it isn’t, but I’m just lying to myself. How do you know if it is truly bad? You simply don’t like it.</p> <p>What is wrong? I’m lonely. I’ve shelved a lot of things I promised to do: creating music, video editing, learning Zig, meeting new people, writing a post about keyboard. I got a job, and instead of being productive, I procrastinate most of the time. I’m lacking intimacy. I’m insecure. I believe I don’t deserve to be loved.</p> <p>I met a girl yesterday. Sasha was cute at first, but then she became mean. Later, she explained that she was aggressive because of a girl in her group of friends. Sasha was sharing her emotions in the chat while that girl was telling the guy Sasha liked how ridiculous she was.</p> <p>Although it seemed childish to me, I was kind to Sasha and tried to cheer her up. The dialogue was kind of awkward, but everything seemed to go fine.</p> <p>Today she just deleted the chat. When I noticed that, I felt a huge spectrum of emotions which I struggle to describe. It was like I’m missing something. Where did I make a mistake? Ignoring the red flags? Being way too passive?</p> <p>I definitely could have been warmer in the dialogue, but other than that I did nothing wrong. Why then do I feel so bad? Why do I always doubt my decisions? Why every time I try to make things better, everything just breaks apart?</p> <p>How can I know what I’m doing wrong? I’m a pretty decent person on paper, but in reality I struggle connecting with people. Maybe everybody else is wrong? That could be legitimate but it changes nothing. I tried to be kind to everyone and not judge myself, but that didn’t help.</p> <p>I’ve noticed a tendency: when I learn more about a person I like, I quickly become disappointed in them and thus in myself. After that, I just lose any motivation to stay in touch.</p> <p>I had a tough time when I was about 14. I felt weak, miserable and abandoned, and there was no one to help me. After that, I learned that you can’t just wait for things to become better by themselves. You are the only person who is responsible for everything that happens to you, and you can’t rely on others to help you. Only you can change your life for the better.</p> <p>That’s a powerful mindset which, as expected, helped me a lot. But now it feels like I’ve lost the momentum. No matter how much effort I put in, there are just no results. Every time I try to reconsider my strategies, I just can’t come up with something better.</p> <p>It is so overwhelming. No matter what I try to do, it just comes to nothing. At this point I just feel helpless.</p> <p>I just want to believe that this is just an unfortunate coincidence, that I just have to keep grinding and everything is going to be fine. But it’s insanely hard when hope is running out.</p><!----></div></div></section><!----><!----></article><!----><!----></div></main> <aside class="hidden h-screen w-16rem shrink-0 flex-col sticky top-0 xl:flex border-l border-outline"><div class="flex-1 overflow-y-auto"><!--[--><div class="p-8"><div class="mb-6 text-sm text-onsurface-var">table of contents</div> <div class="flex flex-col gap-1 text-sm text-onsurface-var"><!--[--><a href="#journal" data-toc-slug="journal" style="scroll-margin-block: 1rem" class="decoration-none pl-2 py-1 flex items-stretch group text-onsurface-var"><!--[--><div class="w-2 border-l shrink-0 group-hover:border-surface border-outline"></div><!--]--> <span class="ml-1"># journal</span></a><!--]--></div></div><!--]--></div></aside> <div class="fixed bottom-0 left-0 z-50 w-full lg:hidden"><!--[!--><!--]--> <header class="flex h-16 items-center justify-between border-t border-outline bg-surface p-8 md:p-12"><a href="/" class="text-lg font-bold decoration-none text-onsurface">@axseem</a> <button class="p-2 text-onsurface bg-surface" aria-label="Toggle Menu"><!--[!--><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><line x1="3" y1="12" x2="21" y2="12"></line><line x1="3" y1="6" x2="21" y2="6"></line><line x1="3" y1="18" x2="21" y2="18"></line></svg><!--]--></button></header></div></div><!----><!--]--><!----></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
