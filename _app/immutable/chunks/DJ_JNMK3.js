For me, reading seemed boring and unproductive. I thought books were useless considering all the various novel ways to consume the information.</p> <p>I was so wrong.</p> <p><img alt="Books I've read in 2024"/></p> <h2 id="how-did-i-get-to-this-point">How did I get to this point?</h2> <p>At the beginning of 2024 I was looking for ways to drastically improve my lifestyle. That’s when I decided to give books a chance. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" rel="nofollow">Atomic Habits by James Clear</a> caught my eye. The topic seemed interesting enough and it had a bunch of good reviews.</p> <p>It was life changing. I was not expecting to get such a great amount of information and for it to be such a pleasant experience. Almost immediately, I felt like I needed more.</p> <p>The book contained a short review by <a href="https://markmanson.net" rel="nofollow">Mark Manson</a>. I explored his work and discovered he had written several bestsellers, my choice fell on <a href="https://markmanson.net/books/subtle-art" rel="nofollow">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</a> and <a href="https://markmanson.net/books/models" rel="nofollow">Models</a>.</p> <p>Those books were amazing, and the information I discovered has changed the way I see the problems and hugely influenced the way I was living.</p> <p>It became clear how useful the habit of reading is, and how much joy it brings. Being impressed with the results, I decided to set a goal of reading 16 books by the end of the year. Honestly it seemed like a huge amount considering I’ve been reading only for a few months. Nevertheless, I quickly accepted such an ambitious challenge. It was the right choice.</p> <h2 id="how-did-it-go">How did it go?</h2> <p>It went great! Turns out all this time, I’ve been just ignoring the whole world of highly accessible and useful knowledge.</p> <p>Sure, it was not always smooth. There were days when I just didn’t feel like reading, or the information from the book was somewhat difficult to absorb. However, those obstacles were easy to overcome, especially considering all the benefits I was getting in exchange.</p> <p>Also during the journey, I discovered something unexpected - the superiority of text-based information. Reading is extremely fast, content is easily navigable when organized in chunks, and the distraction-free nature of plain text helps maintain focus for extended periods.</p> <h2 id="so-what-is-next">So what is next?</h2> <p>Looking back, I’m extremely happy with the decisions I made.</p> <p>I already have a queue of books that I can’t wait to read, and with time it only grows. It’s no longer about a funny challenge but an identity. Reading slowly became a part of me, and revealed the person I want to be.</p> <p>The future looks limitless and I’m extremely excited about it.</p>`,1);function j(o,a){r(a,!1),u();var e=b(),t=h(d(e),8),i=l(t);m(t),p(28),c(()=>g(i,"src",new URL(""+new URL("../assets/books.CRYBJaqi.png",import.meta.url).href,import.meta.url).href)),s(o,e),f()}export{j as default,w as metadata};
