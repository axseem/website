# # about

My name is Maksym Bohdan, but usually people know me as @axseem or just Max. <Age birthdate="2006-01-23"/> At my core, I'm driven by a deep curiosity and an urge to create and explore. I'm extremely fascinated by the process of understanding systems and then optimizing them. I'm always craving for more, which is both a source of frustration and my greatest motivator.

The biggest fear of mine is to live a plain and unfulfilling life. That's why I treat my life as my most important project, one that's in a constant state of being refactored and improved. Ultimately, my goal is to build things and share ideas that might be useful to others.

I share my journey publicly and try to be transparent about the process, including the struggles. I battle with perfectionism, loneliness, and cheap dopamine just like a lot of people do. My approach is to engineer my environment to make the right things easier and the wrong things harder. It's a messy path, and I'm just trying to figure it out one day at a time.
