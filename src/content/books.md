**The Courage to Be Disliked** _by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga_ - ?/10

So far I love the book. Teleology ideas resonate with me really well. It can be somewhat cruel, denying any kind of traumas or damaging experiences, but in exchange it provides full agency and freedom of choice. and often suffers from oversimplification, but still, it gives a really fascinating explanation on why we act one or another way.

### [**Atomic Habits** _by James Clear_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Habits)

It's a hyped book and I guess for a reason. It was the very first book I've deliberately read and likely the reason I kept reading after that. It's main idea is that small, consistent changes compound into big, long-term outcomes. On top of that, it provides a well thought execution steps and tricks. I find it really sound, and perhaps even more important, practical. Sometimes data in the book may seem way to striped and simplified. Book is written in semi-entertaining style which made me read it from the start to then end without a problem.

- **Score:** 9/10
