It's a hyped book and is probably for a good reason. It was the very first book I've deliberately read and likely the reason I kept reading after that. It's main idea is that small, consistent changes compound into big, long-term outcomes. On top of that, it provides a well thought execution steps and tricks. I find it really sound, and perhaps even more important, practical. Sometimes data in the book may seem way to striped and simplified. Book is written in semi-entertaining style which made me read it from the start to then end without a problem.
