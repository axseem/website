### [**Nineteen Eighty-Four** _by George Orwell_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)

The first fiction book I've read. It was somewhat difficult for me to read, but at the end, I didn't regret putting time into it. The main idea of Big Brother is actually as relevant in the current time as it could ever be. Seeing clear relations between described dystopia and the world we are living in right now gave me some real goosebumps. The ending is pretty disturbing and surprisingly profound.

### [**Daring Greatly** _by Brené Brown_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daring_Greatly)

This book definitely has profound ideas I agree with, such as an importance of vulnerability in day to day life. But at the same time, for me it was somewhat boring to read. Because of that, I can hardly remember the arguments author has provided. Maybes it's just me, definitely not a bad book.

### [**Supercommunicators** _by Charles Duhigg_](https://charlesduhigg.com/supercommunicators/)

Interesting to read, but the knowledge felt kinda impractical. Like it advises to ask people deep questions in order to achieve connecting conversations, but at the same time, it doesn't work if you are asking things you are not genuinely interested in. It has a good point but it felt like it lacks important details.

### [**The Expectation Effect** _by David Robson_](https://davidrobson.me/books/the-expectation-effect/)

Be careful with the things you believe in. Using various historical situations book illustrates that your believes have a profound impact on the way you behave and your body functions. It actually quit surprising the scale of influence just a thought can have.

### [**Models** _by Mark Manson_](https://markmanson.net/books/models)

Once again, Mark goes against the grain and expresses the idea which is unusual for such kind of books. The book is about dating and relationships, but instead of giving tips and tricks, it goes deep into what makes people likable, and states that if you want to date a decent person, well, first of all you have to be a decent person. It makes a big stress on authenticity and importance of starting from the root - your identity.

### [**The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck** _by Mark Manson_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Subtle_Art_of_Not_Giving_a_Fuck)

Great book which gives a based view on life happiness. It definitely change the way I perceive everything that happens to me. The author is not afraid to be direct and say things which usually might be considered impolite. Huge W.

### [**Atomic Habits** _by James Clear_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Habits)

It's a hyped book and is probably for a good reason. It was the very first book I've deliberately read and likely the reason I kept reading after that. It's main idea is that small, consistent changes compound into big, long-term outcomes. On top of that, it provides a well thought execution steps and tricks. I find it really sound, and perhaps even more important, practical. Sometimes data in the book may seem way to striped and simplified. Book is written in semi-entertaining style which made me read it from the start to then end without a problem.
