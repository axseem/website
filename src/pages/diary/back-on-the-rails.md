Finally, I'm able to be productive again. I’ve been working on the LLM tool for chatting and handling system tasks via terminal. Yesterday, I managed to accomplish a lot - and it felt truly rewarding.

I’ve kept the 4:30 a.m. wake-up time, and I’m already getting used to it. Going to bed at 8:00 p.m. still feels unusual, but the progress is undeniable. Even better, I’ve had far fewer spontaneous urges to seek distractions throughout the day. I’m pretty satisfied with how everything’s going.
