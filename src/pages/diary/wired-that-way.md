I watched the entire Matrix trilogy. It was pretty fun. Sometimes I felt kinda sad that I couldn’t share this fun with someone, but it did not stop me from enjoying the moment. Most of the rest of the time, I’ve been thinking about everything - though I don’t know how to describe it. The more I try to put it into words, the less satisfied I feel with the result. I’ve been changing so much recently, in ways I could not have seen coming. I’ve begun to notice flaws and opportunities for improvement in my way of reasoning. I feel good, but somewhat unreal, like I’m moving forward, but it’s happening by itself. I am putting effort into making it happen - but that’s not the point. It feels like I’m just wired to do this. The sensation is oddly pleasurable, a belief that no matter what, I’ll never stop growing.
