The internet is designed to make you always feel hungry. Every time I assume I can easily ignore the distractions through sheer will, I fail immediately. **It's shocking how difficult it is to resist the urges.**

Kinda **crazy how far the algorithms have gone**. Every time I visit YouTube to watch **just one video**, I **end up going thorough every one** on the recommendation page. Those things are so well designed to please you and make you wanna keep scrolling. That genuinely terrifies me.

People are wired to do the easiest and most rewarding thing, so **willpower won't help you**. It’s so obvious, I feel dumb falling for the same trick over and over. The only way to escape is to cut off the access.

Yeah, **time for a dopamine detox**. I’ve done it a few times already, and it’s always rewarding in the end. The key is to **design your environment** so there are no harmful "cues". Surround yourself with objects and **patterns that force you to do the right things**.

Okay, this problem is straightforward to solve, but there’s one more - **loneliness**. It always hits hard, I hate this feeling. The thing is, it’s a much harder problem. It’s easy to find relationships but **hard to find meaningful ones**. There’s no way to know in advance if someone will make you wanna spend all your time with them.

Right now, the only approach I can think of is to get to know a hell of a lot of people and **let chance play on my side**. Simple solution, but it’s so hard to actually push yourself to be social with everyone. Still, The **long-term benefits** are so good, you can't ignore them. Hence, I’m ready to **face the awkwardness and discomfort**, striving to the greater goal.

*You can't grow rapidly without failing frequently.*
