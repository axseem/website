Yesterday, I had a fascinating idea. Every day, I spend a lot of time creating something interesting on my laptop. So, I thought, why wouldn't I stream everything I do? In fact, that's a great question. Yeah, streaming is a high-competitive field, and it's not easy to get into. But the point is that I don't have to put a lot of effort into it; I just do the same things I always do, but now also stream them on Twitch. I lose nothing and get a chance to grow a community. It couldn't be better.

I decided not to put off this idea. Right after waking up, I started configuring everything I needed to start streaming. Although it wasn't perfect, it was good enough for the first time. Somewhere in the evening, I launched my [first broadcast](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2419377280). There was nothing crazy. I was just designing the PCB for the keyboard. I was live for a little more than 2 hours, and it was a great experience. Even though it was harder than I originally expected, I liked the process. Also, as a huge bonus, you really can't get distracted from the job, which drastically increased my productivity.

Getting even a small number of viewers is gonna be tough, but I see no reason not to try. I plan on streaming pretty much every day when I have free time. It's an exciting, new experience for me, and I believe in the long run it will pay off.
