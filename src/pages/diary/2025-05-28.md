I've created a new diary page design. It's going to be one continuous page for all the records. This approach feels pretty reasonable, as it's closer to how a physical diary is structured, and it's also much easier to manage that way.

However, it's not released yet, as I'm considering a few tweaks. The main one is changing the mood scale to a 5-point limit. It just feels more natural that way. But I'm also not sure what to do with the old 10-point mood scale records. Leaving them as is feels a bit confusing, yet converting them to the new 5-point scale also feels wrong.

I'm sure there's a good solution to this problem - I just need to think about it a bit more.
