Usually, I write in my diary sometime during the evening. I love to think through everything at such moments, which obviously takes time. Because of that, I often skip bedtime, which is bad for both my health and productivity.

I also used to have reading time right before sleep. Recently, I tried to move the reading time to the morning, and it was a much better experience. There was much less tension, and, generally, I began to feel much more immersed in the process.

The goal is to do all the daily tasks as early as possible. That makes things much simpler, work more efficient, and leaves a lot of free time by the evening. Additionally, arranging tasks in the same order every day will hugely help to build the right habits.

I have to admit that I am clearly moving in the right direction and have already made quite a bit of progress. Perhaps I need to remind myself of that more often. I'm too harsh on myself, considering everything I do to make my life better. I'm extremely lucky to be the way I am.
