I feel anxious about the future. I know that big life changes can only come after continuous small improvements. But sometimes I just feel like I might not have the time to slowly improve. I'm really afraid of falling behind.

Anyway, I've been thinking about what the best thing is I can focus on right now. It's a tough question to answer. There are a lot of things I want to do, things I haven't finished, and things I potentially need to do. I guess I'll mostly focus on programming projects, and go from there. But at the same time, I want to grow my media influence and my social connections in life. Actually, that might be even more important. At least, it's something that fulfills me more than anything else.
