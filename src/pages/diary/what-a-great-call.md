Finally, I'm writing a diary not only when I feel down.

Yesterday was hard. I was desperate, but I'm so much better now. Publishing my writeup was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time.

A lot of people have written to me after, cheering me up and sharing their thoughts. Even though that's probably what I wanted, it's definitely not what I was expecting. The most surprising was the amount of unique ways people were reacting. It was so fascinating to see how different each person was, yet had no trouble finding common ground.

Although I feel much clearer now, the way my mood has changed in just one day scares me a little. Emotions are good at pointing out when something is wrong, but as it turns out, they can also lead you in the wrong directions. Nevertheless, hitting rock bottom definitely made me more aware of my state.

I was way too dramatic questioning if I'm doing everything right. There is plenty of evidence that I am moving in the right direction, so it is pointless to spend a lot of time doubting that. Things don't always work out, and that's okay â€“ just don't stop looking for better approaches.

And to sum up, I am so happy to be surrounded by friends with so many different worldviews and opinions that I can learn from. I can't express just how grateful I am to everyone <3.
