Currently it is 21:40. I'm supposed to be asleep right now, however I'm not. I'm writing this diary while being on a call with my best friend Alice. I asked how she wanted me to write her name, Alice or Alisa, but she let me choose myself. In real time she can see everything I write and she continuously reads it out loud. It is an unusual experience to say the least. We've been thinking about the previous sentence for around 2 minutes. Kinda funny considering it's only 9 words. I'm really glad to be on the call with her and feel absolutely no guilt for skipping my regular bedtime.

Quite rarely do I have an opportunity to have such deep conversations. It allows me to challenge my current worldview, which is a great way to rapidly get better. And at the same time, I just have a great time which I'm lucky to share with such a great person.

And now, I kinda struggle to write anything further. It was a mistake to leave the diary for the late evening. Feel kinda uncomfortable as Alice has to sit watching me doing this entry. It was really fun, but I guess it's enough for today. I had a lot of other thoughts I planned to write into the diary today but I guess, I'll leave them for tomorrow.
