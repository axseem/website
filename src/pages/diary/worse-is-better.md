Perfection is unachievable, yet you can always move towards it. Quite often I get stuck chasing perfection and forget that the actual goal is to get things done. Striving for the best is good, but it shouldn't be a barrier to completing the project. By jumping ahead and trying to get the most polished result possible on the first try, you risk wasting your time on a possibly weak idea. The number one priority is to get the idea going as soon as possible. That way you'll make sure you've worked through all aspects and gathered feedback that will let you know if your vision is any good. Once you see the big picture and understand the whole process, it will be much easier to refine the product.

This is nothing new or extraordinary, and yet I always forget to follow these principles. Not everything matters. In fact, most things don't matter, and you should make sure you spend your time on those that do matter. With all the options we have in today's oversaturated world, it's pretty easy to lose track of what is truly worth your time and effort. However, the same environment allows anyone who is not afraid of difficulties to achieve unimaginable results.
