Don't feel great. I've wasted a lot of time today. I hate that feeling. Why can't it emerge right before I'm about to do something stupid I'll regret later? That would be a fantastic feature. 

At least I slept really good this morning. It was so good, in fact, that I have absolutely no desire to skip bedtime tonight - and because of that, I'll keep this entry short. 

Yeah, that's short enough.
