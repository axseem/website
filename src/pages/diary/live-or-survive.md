It’s Monday. I feel well enough. Still not quite sure what to do. Like, in general - I need money to live. The simplest option is to find a job. However, beyond the money, I’d also want it to provide valuable experience, which is tricky to achieve. Additionally, I’m not fluent in Czech, and that drastically reduces my chances of finding such work in Prague. Hopefully, I’ll move to Ireland in six months, which will simplify things. But can I allow myself to just spend time before moving - doing what I like without earning any income? Probably.
  
Anyway, working a job you don’t like, one that offers nothing more than money, feels absolutely wrong. With such limited choices, it’s hard to find anything better. Work without fulfillment quickly becomes overwhelming, and the results end up being far worse, too.
