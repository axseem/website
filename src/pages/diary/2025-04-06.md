I got scammed and I feel so stupid. Long story short, this morning I found a girl on a dating app, and we liked each other. There was absolutely nothing suspicious, and she seemed pretty sweet. Really, the conversation felt so natural. I even got several voice messages. However, now I can see that those messages were obviously premade and could be easily integrated into any part of the chat.

We agreed to go to an art exhibition today, so we proceeded to buy tickets. You can probably already see where this was going. Yet, somehow I was completely blind to it. She sent me a link to the exhibition's site to buy tickets. The site was clearly suspicious, but I managed to completely ignore that. It was only after I paid $50 and didn't get the tickets that I started to question everything. That's when I began to realize what had happened. I googled the website and found posts from people describing the exact same story that just happened to me.

I felt, and still feel, so bad about the whole situation. Luckily I didn't lose much money, but the scheme was so obvious it makes me really upset with myself. I know I can be quite naive sometimes, but seeing people exploit that just depresses me a lot :(. Well, I guess this is just another lesson learned.

Also, I saved the [chat](./chat) just in case. Anyone can read it, but I would strongly recommend not following any links inside it.
