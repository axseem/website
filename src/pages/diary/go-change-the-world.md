I need more. There is always more to gain, so **why should I stop?** This idea never stops pursuing me. It's like an *endless thirst* for progress eating me up from the inside out. The guilt I feel in periods of stagnation is probably the *worst* feeling I've ever had.

I'm addicted to challenges. It just feels so wrong to choose the most explored path. My parents have criticized me for going against the grain and always choosing what I want instead of what others want from me. I've been told that only a *fool* would choose to make life harder when they can avoid it. It took me a *long* time to learn that **the majority can often be wrong**. Of all the population in the world, **there is no one you can trust more than yourself**.

I wish there were more ambitious people who pursue their dreams despite all the odds - the ones who make the world move. No matter how hard it is, you always need to convince yourself that **you can make anything come true**. Otherwise, you are simply *doomed* to become part of the bland majority.
