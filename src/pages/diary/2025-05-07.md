I did it once again... I was putting off writing this diary record, and now there are only twenty minutes left before midnight, which means I'll have to speedrun this one.

Because of how late I fell asleep yesterday (technically today), I woke up around 10 AM. Waking up that late makes the day feel so short, and trying to compensate for it only makes things worse, because then you just wake up later the next day. A vicious cycle.

Most of the day, I've been playing around with the 3D printer. My PETG filament was delivered today, so I was testing it out. It's surprisingly glossy, which I don't really like. Anyway, I guess it'll be good for rigidity-first prints. I was also looking for models that would help me manage the mess I have on my shelves. Gridfinity is a great standard, as it has a huge amount of compatible models, however, I don't really like its static nature. It seems perfect for drawers, but not shelves. Luckily, I found a bunch of Rugged Box designs with Gridfinity slots inside. That's actually a genius concept. Nevertheless, I don't really like the designs I found, as there are a lot of subtle things I'd like to be different. Because of that, I'll probably design my own. It shouldn't be that hard, and I guess I'll have a great time doing it.
