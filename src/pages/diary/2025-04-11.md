Yesterday, I tried to fall asleep on time but failed, getting only six and a half hours of sleep - which has been common for me recently. My goal is to get at least eight hours, as that's the amount that makes me feel absolutely amazing throughout the whole day. Surprisingly, though, I woke up today feeling relatively good.

It makes me think about habit formation. I know I can easily build habits just by adjusting my environment, but for some reason, I've stopped using this trick. It might be one of the easiest and most efficient ways to form a habit, at least in my experience. Instead, way too often, I foolishly rely solely on my willpower. Then, after inevitably failing to resist, I blame myself for being weak. This pattern often happens almost unconsciously, but recognizing it makes it clear: that's the bad habit. Acknowledging it is a great first step toward change. True resilience, I suspect, isn't just about strong willpower, but about setting yourself up so you don't constantly need to test it - essentially, not provoking yourself in the first place.
