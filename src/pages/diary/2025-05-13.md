I started writing this record about an hour ago, and the words I've been putting down are coming out surprisingly well. I want to finish it and publish it as a blog post, but since it's fairly late, I'll do that tomorrow. I'm pretty tired of wasting my time on empty pleasures that have nothing substantial behind them, and that's what triggered me to pour out everything I think about it.

The topic is certainly nothing new - not for me, nor for the world. Nevertheless, I've just reached a point where everything makes so much sense, not only from a theoretical but also from an emotional standpoint. As a result, I feel I've been able to express myself in a peculiarly appealing way. I think this piece has the potential to make others not only realize but truly feel the problem, to connect with it on a much deeper level. And last but not least, it will be a great opportunity for reflection and reframing the problem for myself, helping me to grow.
