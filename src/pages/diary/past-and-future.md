I suddenly felt like revisiting all the music I once listened to. It's pretty cool. I often delete tracks after playing them on repeat for way too long. Hearing them again after so long feels like coming home.

Yesterday around midday, I opened Instagram to upload my daily photo as usual. When I launched the app, I noticed a message from someone I didn't recognize. It was a girl asking if we could get to know each other. We've been chatting for a while now, and she seems to be quite a kind and funny person. From time to time, I'm lucky to run into good people.
