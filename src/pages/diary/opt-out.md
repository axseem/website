The weekend has almost ended. I did pretty much nothing. I have been playing a lot of chess, watching videos, reading Reddit, anything but useful things. It's so frustrating. For some reason I just can't balance it. The moment I start doing some meaningless routine, it's so hard to switch to a more demanding task later. I have no idea how other people do that. No way I am the only one who just can't do it. Seems like the only option is to fully opt out of all the activities that provide nothing more than just pleasure.
