Today was a good day. Since early this morning, I've been working on the new [keyboard](https://github.com/anywhy-io/flake) design. I managed to stay productive for pretty much the whole day and, as a result, got a lot done.

I also ate almost nothing today. I'd run out of chicken and apples, so I decided to eat lightly and buy groceries in the evening. All I had were two sandwiches and a few peanuts. Nevertheless, I feel absolutely greatâ€”probably even better than usual. I just got back from the supermarket. Unfortunately, there was no chicken breast, so I bought ham instead, along with several apples. It become hard to live without fruits :).

There's still an intense feeling of loneliness. However, I somehow manage to ignore it. Can't tell if it's a good approach, but at least it helps me stay in the moment for periods of time. Actually, I hardly see any viable option to fix that problem - at least, not quickly. However, something tells me that's okay. I just need to shift my expectations for the long term, and I'll benefit much greater from that.
