This morning I finished reading [Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Never). It's a thought-provoking book that has dramatically shifted my worldview. I've learned a great deal about environmental issues and discovered new ways of reasoning about large-scale problems.

I've also just begun reading [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://davidepstein.com/range/), which seems to be exactly what I want and need. The book's premise about the value of broad knowledge across multiple domains already resonates with me. So far it looks promising, and nicely complements the ideas I recently had.
