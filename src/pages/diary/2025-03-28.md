I've noticed that limiting my time before writing drastically improves both the experience and the result of it. That's fascinating, since naturally, it seems like it should be the other way around. I have often read and heard that creating artificial deadlines tricks your brain into being more focused on the task at hand. However, I've never thought it has such a significant effect.

Recently, I've felt a desire to start drawing. I don't know why this happens, but it just seems so fun to be able to draw. There are so many cool activities in the world. Sometimes I wish I could try everything. Actually, I believe it's not that difficult to achieve that. All I need is to listen to myself and not be afraid of the unexplored.
