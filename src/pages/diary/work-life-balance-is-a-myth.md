It's noticeable how I improve every day, yet I still wish I were doing more. I'm really enjoying the gym lately. About two months ago, I had the idea to try working out at a gym instead of at home. I wasn't expecting it to be such a pleasant experience, I'd even call it addictive. Currently, I only work out on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, but I'm thinking I should start going every day. Recently, it's become clear that on days when I don't visit the gym in the morning, I'm far less productive, even though there's theoretically more time for work.

Paradoxically, doing more things grants more time and the possibility to do even more things. Sometimes I wonder if we need rest as much as everyone says we do. Most of the time, I feel absolutely no deprivation after long periods of deep work. However, the moment of contrast getting into work right after resting feels like torture. It seems like splitting time into chunks of work and rest is actually more harmful than helpful. At least for me, a better approach is to look for activities that fulfill you, don't tire you, and allow to be productive at the same time. There's no point in doing what you don't like, whatsoever.
