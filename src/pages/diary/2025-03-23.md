I've noticed that lately I've been writing much less in this diary. I've been leaving out so many things I'm thinking and worrying about, sometimes just because I'm afraid of what others might think if they read it. Which is ironic, because I started a public diary to break free from that fear in the first place. I want to be raw, no matter what others say or think.

But I'm still unsure what can I share publicly, and what shouldn't I? "Share anything that doesn't raise safety concerns" seems like an obvious answer. Yet when I really think about it, almost any personal information can be weaponized - it's just a matter of degree. I don't feel unsafe, but it still seems right to stay cautious even without an immediate threat. For now, I'm okay publishing nearly everything about myself, but not details involving people I know without their agreement. Yeah, this feels like a solid middle ground.
