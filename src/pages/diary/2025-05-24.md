Yesterday, I pushed my website redesign. It wasn't quite as polished as I'd hoped, but I realized I could tweak it forever. So, I decided to at least get it to the same level of functionality as before and hit publish. I'm pretty satisfied with the new UI.

Today was all about designing and printing presents for my mom and sis, who I'm meeting tomorrow. I for sure should have done all of that in advance, but it is what it is. There's still a lot I planned to do before the day ends. What a great time to speedrun everything.
