Yesterday evening, I finished all my work and decided to play around with LLMs. I prompted Gemini to act as a "self-improvement coach" and gave it a try. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. I didn’t even realize just how quickly three hours had flown by. The insights in our dialogue were surprisingly profound. Gemini’s tone felt warm and almost *genuine* - a striking contrast to the AI interaction I was used to. It’s clear this technology holds immense potential. I’d always viewed AI as a tool for narrow tasks, but now I see it’s better approached as a broadly applicable multi-tool. This mindset unlocks creativity by pulling the mind out of rigid patterns, opening the way for truly unique solutions.
