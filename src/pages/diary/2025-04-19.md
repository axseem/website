I've spent pretty much the whole day playing with the 3D printer. Printed a bunch of fun stuff, figured out most of the slicer settings, and even started designing a custom cable winder. I got a bit carried away, though â€“ it's already 23:30! Gotta post this before midnight, so I'll keep it brief. Oh, and completely unrelated, but I also ate almost 2kg of bananas today, which was absolutely amazing.
