Yesterday, I wrote about how little I feel I'm able to do right now. But at the end of the day, when I thought about everything I had actually done, it wasn't that bad. Yeah, I probably could do better, and the feeling that I'm not working at my full efficiency kinda overwhelms me. But the point is, I'm doing good, and I keep going. It's much easier to take the blame for things I haven't done than to celebrate what I've achieved.
