The future is dim, yet it seems to be extremely close. I've been thinking a lot about it lately, as it's hard not to do so. I may be wrong, but it seems like we're just a few steps away from a complete change in the world. Pretty much every day, we get huge news about how smart the new AI is and how far technological progress is going. It's truly fascinating - I can't be glad enough to live in such a fantastic time.

However, this rapid development makes me question even more where I belong in this future. My anxiety is growing fast, and trying to analyze how all these changes will impact our lives is harder than ever.

Where should I invest all my time in the long run? What should I do so I won't be left on the sidelines of progress? I guess the optimal choice is to increase erudition and overall intelligence. At that point, I doubt there's any reason to focus too deeply on narrow skills. Flexibility and reasoning have always been important, and they'll probably be even more valuable in the future. Not giving up and continuing to improve as a human being rather than an expert in some field might actually be the best way to go.
