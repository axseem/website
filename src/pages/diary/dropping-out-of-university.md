I’m going to drop out of university by the end of the academic year. There are a lot of problems with my uni, but the main one is that it just doesn’t give me anything valuable. I’m curious if it is a problem particularly with CTU. Will different universities give me a better experience? I have no idea, but I see no reason not to try.

I believe universities do not have something you can’t learn yourself. We are living in such a fascinating time, when anyone can learn anything, all they need is a strong desire. However, new knowledge isn't the reason I’m not giving up on the university idea, the environment is. It seems like a natural place to find diverse, valuable, and fulfilling relationships. Yet it didn’t happen to me at CTU, so I could be wrong.

It is not my priority, but sooner or later I would like to try other universities and see if they are better. It would probably also be fun to choose a domain unrelated to information technology, as I’m not sure if I want to spend my time going through things I already know.

Anyway, I’m convinced most of the world overrates university degrees. There is no secret knowledge or experience to them. Nevertheless, I'm very drawn to the fairytale of student life, and it feels wrong to give up on it so easily.
