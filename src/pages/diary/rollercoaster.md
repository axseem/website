So, another day has passed. It was ok. My mood is a bit down but nothing serious, it could be much worse. I'm not sure if it's true, but it seems like there is a pattern. My emotional state regularly rises and falls during some period of time (like a week or two). I'm curious if that's just me or is it a part of human nature. Even if it's not, I guess it's ok - no one is perfect. I would like to keep it short for today. I'll go take a daily selfie and go to sleep.
