Fell asleep at 3 AM last night â€“ that's a record! I was completely absorbed in making the CAD model for that cable winder. It's seriously addictive. Even though it was a really enjoyable process, it's absolutely no excuse for staying up that late. Still, I let myself stay awake longer than usual. For the last few days, I've been trying not to force myself to do anything, just allowing myself to follow whatever feels right. It seems to be helping, actually. I feel much more refreshed and ready to tackle the important things.
