I've been writing records every day for more than 4 weeks now. Honestly, I'm impressed how long I managed to keep going. This diary was a really great idea. It indeed helps me understand my thoughts and feelings, just like I thought it would. However lately I've noticed that it is no longer as effective as it was at the beginning. The input-output ratio seems to decrease, so I began to think if I should continue writing diary.

Nevertheless, whatever I choose, I enjoy the process of writing and will definitely continue to write every time I have something interesting on my mind. I won't try to write some big blog posts with ideas that will be valuable for readers. Another cool idea I have is to make videos based on those posts. That way I could try new field for me, while expanding the reach of my thoughts. We will see how it goes.
