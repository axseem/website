I can't recall exactly what I was taking from the shelf, but because of the mess I have there, some stuff fell onto my table in the process. Among all the things that tumbled down were my Truthear Hexa IEMs.

A long time ago, I had cleaned them using isopropanol, and as a result, the left driver started crackling at high volume levels. I was really upset about that, as I loved their sound so much. I was also kinda confused, as I was sure that IPA couldn't cause them any harm. Obviously, I left them to dry for a few days, but unfortunately, that crackling sound never went away. I ended up ordering and switching to the more budget-friendly Truthear Gates.

Now, for some reason, I became really curious to test them out once again. And oh gosh... they worked! Not only was there no crackling sound, but after exclusively using budget IEMs for a while, these sounded absolutely astonishing.

I was extremely happy about that. I checked, and a new pair would cost me about $80. It felt almost like I'd received an unexpected gift.

As a result, I spent the whole day listening to music. I went through a huge chunk of my main playlist, after which I started looking for old songs I used to listen to. I'm seriously overflowing with this feeling of nostalgia. Amazing how such apparently small things can gift such a great amount of bright emotions.
