Today was the last stage of the interview. It's just insane how unnecessarily complicated the hiring process is. Anyway, now I can breathe out and keep working on my projects.

I actually planned to start doing that right after today's interview. And yet, it feels like I just can't. Recently, I've forbidden myself YouTube and Twitch, as they consume way too much time, and I can't seem to limit my time on them as they're way too addictive. As a result, I feel unmotivated and am generally in a bad mood.

I've noticed that after restricting access to any kind of easy pleasure source, I quickly start suffering from an overwhelming feeling of loneliness. There's a high chance that's the actual source of my struggles with addictions. I just try to numb negative emotions and make it seem like I'm not alone by watching Twitch streams, for instance.

I guess, and really hope, that for the most part, it's withdrawal, and after going through it, my emotional state will stabilize.
