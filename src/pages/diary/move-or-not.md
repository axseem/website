I’m full of energy to build things and feel like I can get a lot done today. I’m kinda thrilled. That’s interesting considering I only slept seven hours instead of my usual eight. Lately, I’ve been thinking about moving abroad and whether it’s a reasonable step right now. After comparing all the options, Canada seems like the only viable choice. AFAIK, it’s not easy to get there, but in the long run, it could be a great move. Still, I need to think about it more.
