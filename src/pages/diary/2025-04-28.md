I'm procrastinating really hard right now, barely managing to do basic everyday routines. I also haven't streamed today, just like yesterday. I planned to stream Flake v2 assembly yesterday, but was so tired after the trip that I decided to put it off until tomorrow. However, today I have absolutely no excuses for why I didn't go live. I just haven't felt like streaming today.

Nevertheless, I tweaked OBS configuration and requested access to live streams on YouTube, so tomorrow I'll try to broadcast on both platforms at the same time.

Yeah, also yesterday I didn't go to bed as I wrote I would in my diary, and instead, was hanging out until 2 AM. It's kinda funny how the realization of the amount of undone things easily acts as a good excuse to skip my schedule for the day, and yet, I keep doing anything but completing those tasks. Anyway, today is going to be different. So after posting this entry and selfie, I'll ignore all the distracting urges and fall asleep. I'm already past the time, but if I can manage to get to sleep earlier than I did yesterday, that's good enough already.
