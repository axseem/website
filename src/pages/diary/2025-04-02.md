I'm getting a bit lazy lately. Yesterday, before falling asleep, I thought about whether I really had to go to the gym today. My thinking was that three days a week is already enough. There was no need to go there every single workday.

Obviously, that's wrong. I go there five days a week because it makes me feel better and grants me the momentum to keep going for the whole day. Those thoughts simply sabotage me. It's not about in-the-moment desire, but about discipline.

Eventually, a lot of things can become boring over time, and the thought of doing them will be highly unattractive. But that's okay. As long as I see the reason to do them, I should never stop.
