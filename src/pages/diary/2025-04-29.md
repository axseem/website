Today, I spent the morning cleaning my flat. It feels so much more comfortable to be in here now. Having an almost completely clear desk is incredibly satisfying and refreshing.

However, I still haven't finished cleaning. There's still a ton of miscellaneous stuff lying in a mess on my shelves. I suddenly remembered that I hadn't written anything in my diary today, so I decided to quickly fix that.

Yeah, and almost immediately after that, I got an email invite to a job interview, a call from Mom, and the printing I started earlier finally finished. So, this paragraph is being written several hours later. It looks like I'll have a technical interview in the next few days. I haven't been programming for a while, so it's a great time to refresh my skills.
