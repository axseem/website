Time flies way too fast. I'm always short on time. Obviously, the main cause is that I don't manage it properly. Each day I waste at least 2 hours that I could spend producing something valuable. That's a hell of a lot lost, and I can't afford it. Being productive all the time is just a regular habit, like everything else. I have to embrace it and intensively keep forming that habit. I need to get used to constantly ask myself if what I'm doing throughout the day really matters.

The world is rapidly changing, and there is no time to hesitate. I want to always be in the front line, and to achieve that, I have to adapt quickly. There is no point in investing time in narrow skills anymore. Considering the progress that LLMs have made in recent years, all the hard skills will be automated soon enough. Now, being able to see the wider picture is much more important. In the near future, general intelligence paired with fast adaptation will probably be the most crucial factors for personal success. And even if I'm wrong, improving those skills will pay off anyway, as they are pretty valuable even in today's world.
