I've adjusted my daily goals. I'll be reading for one hour a day instead of two, and also cutting my gym visits down to three days a week from five. I've noticed my efficiency dropping lately - dedicating more hours just wasn't giving me better results. Hopefully, this adjustment will help reduce the chances of burnout too.
