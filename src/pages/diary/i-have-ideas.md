So... yet another day. I feel pretty good today. I haven’t been working on personal projects for a while now. I guess it’s time to change that. I have several software and hardware project ideas on my mind. I’m excited to start implementing any of them, but recently, the question of monetization has been on my mind more often. Working on my ideas and earning money from them is a dream come true. However, many of my ideas are hard to monetize, and yet, I have to find a way to pay the bills. Being dependent on money is really limiting. Nevertheless, I think I’m pretty close to solving it. I just need to keep going.
