I finally got a good night's sleep, and life feels so much better! Plus, the weather today is especially nice - it's going to be 20 degrees around noon. I've really missed the warmth. I'm planning to go shopping for some new clothes, especially sportswear since mine is really worn out. Maybe I'll find something cool for everyday wear too.
