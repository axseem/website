I'm running out of time. It's the first time I've put things off this badly; I barely have time to write today's diary entry before it's technically tomorrow. I don't want to skip a day, but I also don't want to fall asleep that late.

I can't seem to manage anything â€“ I can't keep my urges under control or stick to my plan. I feel so undisciplined, and it frustrates me so much.

Lately, I feel like I'm really stagnating, and realizing that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I want to change, but these past few days, it's just been so hard. I keep falling for that sweet, quick hit of short-term dopamine, only to regret it later, instead of putting effort into something I'll actually be proud of.

Why am I doing this to myself?
