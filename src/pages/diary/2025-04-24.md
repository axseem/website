Just a quick record since I forgot to write this morning, and it's already late.

Good news though: I finally figured out how to make production-quality keycaps on my printer! Managed to get it relatively quick and with minimal faults. I'm actually typing on them right now, and they feel absolutely amazing.

On another note, I also almost finished the new design for my website. Can't wait to start building it. Currently it's built with Astro, but I'm debating whether to keep it purely static. It would be so much better if I could upload content (like diary entries and photos) directly through the site from my phone. The tricky part is that most of the site's content is inherently static, so turning it into an SPA seems like an unnecessary complication. Still figuring out the best approach.

Oh, and it was rainy today. I was really missing that fresh smell that comes after the rain.
