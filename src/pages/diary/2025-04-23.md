Yay, it's an early morning diary record! The last one was like a week ago. Time to fix that. To be honest, it was hard to wake up, especially considering I only slept for six hours. Still, I'm feeling great and can't wait to start working.

The plan for today is to continue redesigning my website and figure out how to efficiently make 3D-printed keycaps. Yeah, yesterday I discovered I can print keycaps for keyboards! After playing around with slicer settings and printing orientation, they're turning out to be really good quality. I'd often heard that FDM printers weren't suitable for such small and detailed prints, but it seems they're actually good enough. Self-made keycaps also happen to be much cheaper than store-bought ones and grant an incredible level of customization.

I guess that's a solid plan for today, but if there's time left, I'll look into the process of declaring self-employment. As far as I understand, there's an option to do everything online, so maybe I could even get that done today too.
