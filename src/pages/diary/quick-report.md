I'll be quick. Another day has passed. My mood is not the best, but not the worst either.  Feel kinda tired of this routine life, but I'm not sure how to make it brighter. I feel guilty spending my time resting, especially considering I have so much to do. My socialization level is still low, but I'm working on that.

Generally, my thoughts are clear and my emotions are stable. I'm doing a great job developing useful habits and getting rid of harmful ones. However, I feel that I could do better in that regard. I have to.
