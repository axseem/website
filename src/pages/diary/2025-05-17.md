It's really hard to do anything. Instead of actually getting to work on something, I just mentally prepare to start without ever really starting, or only doing it after a huge period of time. That expectation of a job that needs to be done, without actually doing it, is so draining. Just starting this writeup took me almost half a day.

I planned to record and edit a short video about reaching the 100th day of my daily selfie journey. Considering the day is almost over, I doubt I'll be able to do that today. That fact is really demotivating, and the worst part is, tomorrow will most likely be exactly the same. I have to at least start something today.
