It was a nice day. I bought a bunch of new clothing today. I usually wear fairly simple outfits, without any prints. However, I decided to try out other styles, so I bought more casual-looking clothes while still trying to keep things simple.

I also got a bunch of new photos today. They're actually impressively good, so I was happy scrolling through them by the end of the day.
