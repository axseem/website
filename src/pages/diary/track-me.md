So far, I’m doing great. It’s still hard to stay productive for long periods of time; however, I’m managing to avoid giving in to my urges without too much effort. Yesterday, I came up with a cool addition to my diary: every day, I’ll rate my mood on a scale from 1 to 10. Over time, this data will accumulate, letting me build statistics and uncover hidden correlations or patterns. How cool is that? From now on, every entry will include a colorful `mood` indicator to show my mindset at the time of writing.
