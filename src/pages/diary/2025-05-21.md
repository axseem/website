Yesterday kinda sucked, but it is what it is. Interestingly, lately I've managed not to blame or judge myself for it, and that actually helps a lot. The point isn't to overlook my mistakes, but rather to accept them as something that just happens and to be more sympathetic towards myself. Now that I write it down, it sounds pretty obvious, but I'd just never thought about it that way. Thinking about myself like I'm another person feels really weird, but it actually helps a lot in understanding myself better. It just makes it so much harder to be biased about the situation, and that kind of objectivity is often important.
