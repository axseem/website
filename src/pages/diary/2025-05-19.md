For the last several days, I've been streaming my website rewrite, dedicating just an hour a day to it. As a result, I've managed to get a huge portion of it done. I mean, that's an incredible result considering it was only about 3 hours in total. It's in moments like these I realize just how powerful small, cumulative improvements can be.

I recall reading Atomic Habits for the first time and being impressed by its seemingly simple yet profound idea: massive changes don't require massive action. It clicked so well with me back then, but over time, I often forget this principle. I guess that's just how it is, though. so many things we do automatically, without giving ourselves a moment to fully realize their impact. And that really underscores why it all comes back to habits. Now, I've got a strong urge to reread the book.
