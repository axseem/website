So I got home today around 3 AM, and fell asleep around 4 AM. It's late evening now and I don't feel sleepy at all. Looks like I'll need to put in a bit of effort to get back to my usual sleep routine.

Still, I absolutely don't mind, as yesterday was absolutely awesome. We went to so many places and talked about so many things. The walk was so long, my legs were really aching by the end of the day. We also took a bunch of funny selfies. Luckily, all that 'one selfie a day' practice over the last few months paid off :)

Anyway, it's already late. Gonna clean up a little and head to bed.
