I feel kinda empty. Today wasn't the best day. Pretty much the whole day, I tried to stop procrastinating. Only by evening did I make some progress and started doing a few minor tasks. It's really hard to focus on anything useful. On the other hand, I can no longer tell what activities even count as useful for me right now. Maybe I should ease the pressure I'm putting on myself. Sometimes it seems like I know what I *should* do - and yet I still doubt myself and just... don't. It's so weird. At what point will I find the answers? Do they even exist? Maybe I just need a bit more time. But do I have that time? I have no idea, and the overwhelming sense that I'm running out of it never leaves me.
