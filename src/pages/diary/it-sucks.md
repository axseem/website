I feel lonely most of the time. I just don't know what to do with that. Not being fluent in Czech makes the problem even harder to solve. I wonder if it will become better when I move to an English-speaking country. It's difficult to ignore the issue either. It annoys me all the time and does not allow me to fully focus on other problems.

Feeling down is destructive. I've noticed that when I'm overwhelmed, I'm more likely to make decisions I regret later. It sucks.

I don't know why but there is a hope that someone will just come and rescue me. They say that you'll never be happy with someone if you can't be happy by yourself. But what am I missing? Why do I always feel lonely? This is the toughest puzzle I've had so far.
