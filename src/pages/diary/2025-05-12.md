I'm about to reach the 100th day of my daily selfie streak. I won't pretend I didn't expect to go this far. In fact, I absolutely did, and even more â€“ to continue indefinitely, without any reason to stop.

The longer I live, the more I'm fascinated by the idea of pursuing things that seem out of reach. *You always have to be somewhat delusional about your capabilities, so you never stop pushing the boundaries of current possibilities.*

After reaching my 100th selfie, I want to create a short clip about it and post it on TikTok/Shorts/Reels. It feels like a fun experiment, and I'm also curious to test my attention-drawing skills. These platforms are usually much more competitive in this regard, as people are used to saturated, quick content. In addition to that, I really wanna play around with writing catchy scripts, practicing speech techniques, and creating simple but cool-looking editing.
