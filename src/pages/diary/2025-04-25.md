Feels like I don't have much to say right now. Honestly, I'd rather be sleeping for another couple of hours, but whatever.

Anyway, I got [Flake](https://github.com/anywhy-io/flake) v2 keyboard PCBs yesterday, and the plan is to solder them today. I'm thrilled about it! If everything goes well, I'll rewrite the documentation and build guide, and then I'll post the new version. It would also be cool to solder another one during a live stream â€“ I think I might be able to do that this Sunday.

Yeah, that's all cool and exciting, but I still can't actually sell them because I haven't tackled the self-employment paperwork yet (._.). At this point, it feels kind of ridiculous. I just need to start, and I know it'll get much easier after that. It always works that way. Really need to break this habit of putting things off until the last minute.
