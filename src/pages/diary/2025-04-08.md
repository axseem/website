So, I just turned what was originally another diary entry into a full blog post: [How Crazy Politics Cost Me $1,500](../../blog/how-crazy-politics-cost-me-1500-dollars). It just kept getting longer, and I figured it was good enough to publish properly! That's my excuse for keeping this diary record brief today ;).

Otherwise, things are looking up. Feeling really motivated to work and actually managing to get stuff done lately. I'm also planning to hit Twitch more often. Hope this good streak continues.
