It’s Wednesday evening, the day’s almost over, and I’m pleased with how it went.

I’m **gaining momentum** really quickly - every day I’m doing more than before. I’m so grateful for **how addictive being efficient can be**. There was so little temptation to just lie down for a minute, scroll Instagram, or watch YouTube. It feels like a huge step.

Today **I rewrote the website**. For now it has pretty much the same functionality as the previous one, but allows me to easily extend it however I want. I plan to **move almost all of my online presence to it**. For instance, it’d be pretty cool to host all my Instagram photos there.

I've also been thinking through ideas of what **cool things I could do** that I could pursue as a potential career. The brightest idea? Music. **I love music**. Every single day, no matter what I’m doing, there’s a high chance I’m listening to it. **I adore creating stuff** too, and combining those two passions sounds like a wild win.

The catch? **I have absolutely no idea how music theory works**. But honestly, **that’s the most exciting part**. There’s so much to learn and discover. Writing lyrics, composing melodies, singing vocals - it all **sounds challenging but at the same time extremely fun**.

*I can't wait to dive headfirst into this process.*
