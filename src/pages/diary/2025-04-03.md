Today I didn't manage to wake up on time and slept through the whole morning. After finally waking up, I grabbed my phone and spent most of the day scrolling through Instagram. I feel so guilty now, and it's an awful feeling.

After a few hours of this, I started to feel like the day was already ruined. Of course, that's a destructive conclusion. Such thoughts just keep me stuck in this loop instead of using the rest of the day as I truly want. It's never too late to change things.
