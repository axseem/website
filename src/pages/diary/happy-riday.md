Banana milkshakes are so damn good. I've been making them every morning for a while already and I really love them. It's Friday already. Can't wait to solder several keyboards tomorrow and send them to customers. One problem has occurred recently. Reading for 2 hours a day is not hard; however, finding non-fiction books you would like to read for long sessions is much harder. Perhaps I have to dedicate several days to make a big list of books that I'll potentially like reading. Also I've been putting off the idea of creating a book reading platform. Feel really guilty for that. Have to make at least some prototype during this weekend.
