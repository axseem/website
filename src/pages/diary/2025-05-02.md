I was expecting my new roommate to arrive today, but it didn't happen. That kinda threw off my plans, as I'd set aside the first half of the day for him.

Anyway, I ended up spending most of the day streaming and trying to solve some programming problems. Honestly, when I'm interacting with people on stream, I get so caught up in the communication that my brain completely stops focusing on anything else complex. I think I probably need to change how I stream, then. It would be more productive if I didn't try to tackle important tasks while streaming, just so I don't get distracted. I'll still stream every day, but maybe for shorter periods, focusing solely on entertainment or occasionally combining it with less crucial tasks.
