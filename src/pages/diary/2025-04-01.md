I'm getting back to writing in my diary in the morning. I slept for six and a half hours, which doesn't feel great. Sleep is important and I can't neglect it. Writing in my diary in the evening increases the risk of going to sleep later than needed. Generally, shifting tasks to the morning makes life much easier. I've written about this not long ago, but it's good to remind myself from time to time.
