I feel so down right now. Also, it's not like I have a lot to say, as not much really changed. It's like the tension just broke the threshold, and my mood deep dived to the bottom. 

As I wrote yesterday, I've been working offline and dedicate live broadcast purely for entertaining. However nothing went as I expected. I barely managed to do any work, because I just didn't felt like doing it, and was always looking for a ways to distract myself. And my stream also didn't went well. I decided to download League of Legends, and play it on stream. I've been playing it for a long time, but dropped the game completely around two years ago. Now I clearly see why I did it. It's not like the game is bad, or the gameplay was not satisfying. There just were constant feeling deep inside of me that I just waste my time. Even though I could make it disappear for some period of time, it never stopped haunting me. And actually, that feeling is completely justified as I in fact get nothing but waste time playing it.

I can say, that I'm clearly lack deep relationships right now, but what also clear is that it is not something that gets fixed in a week or even a month. Also I understand that I have a lot of responsibility and a lot of task I have to prioritize first. They seem to never end. Solving my problems one by one, finding new ways to do things better and managing to not going crazy no longer feels like a great achievement but rather a baseline requirements to survive.
