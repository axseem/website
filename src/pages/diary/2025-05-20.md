I planned to organize all the stuff on my shelf today. Since I started soldering and then 3D printing, the amount of things there has grown drastically. However, I've not done that. Instead, I've been sleeping the first half of the day and doing nothing the other half. I feel pretty guilty about it, but unfortunately, that guilt just doesn't help. It provides a momentary push in the right direction but doesn't help me stay there.

Either way, I feel bad - whether it's from withdrawal or guilt. But at least with withdrawal, I know that I'm doing the right thing, right? Anyway, it's difficult to write or even think about something meaningful in such a state. I'll just go stream and then buy some milk, while also taking one selfie in the process to keep the habit intact.
