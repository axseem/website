3D printing is such a cool thing. The more I play with it, the more unique ways I find to practically use it. I'd even say it's too great. I'm literally doing almost nothing but looking through online models, designing my own, and printing them.

It's kind of funny, but this hyperfocus means there are much more important things I'm not doing. Perhaps the most important is tackling my unemployment. I still haven't applied for self-employment, nor have I been programming or searching for open vacancies.

To be honest, I've been pretty messy lately. I can't really pin down why. Yeah, as I mentioned before, it's kind of a tough period for me, and I often feel really isolated. However, that's not an excuse. I'm seriously addicted to any kind of short-term pleasure and keep choosing cheap dopamine over meaningful work. It's really upsetting.

The great thing is I can recognize this. Now, I just need to start working on it. I've noticed that setting a specific start time never works for me; I always postpone it and never actually begin what I planned. That's why I'm going to try and start everything I've been putting off immediately, including fixing my sleep schedule. I need to constantly ask myself if what I'm doing at any given moment really matters in the long term.
