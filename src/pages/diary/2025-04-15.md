To be honest, yesterday wasn't exactly a great day, or at least the first half felt that way. But things turned around in the evening when I went live on Twitch. I didn't really feel like streaming then, but since I've committed to doing it every workday, I pushed myself to do it anyway. And honestly, I'm glad I did. I spent the time playing chess and chatting with other players - it ended up being a really cozy stream that I actually enjoyed.

I've noticed I often get this feeling that I understand almost nothing about the things I'm involved in. It seems like no matter how much I learn, I just end up with even more questions. It's really frustrating because it feels like I'm not making any real progress. Recently, though, my perspective has shifted a little. There's always gonna be more unknowns than knowns, right? The point isn't to know everything, but to keep moving forward and keep trying to understand, even when you feel like you don't know enough.
