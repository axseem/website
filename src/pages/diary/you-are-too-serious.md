Yeah, that’s true - **I’m too damn serious**. I’ve always been (and still am) a fan of humor, but lately, being funny has been tough for me. *What happened?* I have no idea. Or maybe… I know.

I don’t talk to people much. Most days, I just sit in silence. **Only a tiny fraction of my time is spent hanging out with others**. That ain’t good. **People are everything** - they make life brighter, minds healthier, and jobs easier. If I was asked to **pick the most important skill** to succeed today, **I’d choose charisma**. It’s simple: we live in a world built, managed, and run by people. The only way to thrive is to get on with them.

Charisma isn’t some mystical trait - **it’s just a regular skill**, like anything else. And **like any skill, you have to practice** in order to improve. Humor is a huge part of being charismatic. It doesn't take much effort to recall how easy and comfortable you feel with a funny person around. Obviously, that’s not everything, but **it’s a solid start**.

Are there other ways to become that friend everyone laughs with? Probably, but they’re not as effective as spend more time among people. One thing’s for sure - **watching funny videos won’t cut it**. Observing others isn’t enough - you gotta do the thing or the habit won't emerge. Try this: recall a moment that made you laugh. What made it work? **Analyze those situations, then create new ones** using what you learned.

Funny enough, I’ve written this whole rant about humor without cracking a single joke. Well, here it comes. Why eggs don’t tell jokes? They’d crack up! Not even my joke, but who cares? *Practice and consistency - that’s what matters.*
