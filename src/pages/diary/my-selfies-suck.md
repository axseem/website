You see, I love making and sharing pictures of myself, but **I literally suck at taking photos**. 

**Selfies are an oddly funny** thing in themselves, **but there's more to it**. Your **photos are like a social portfolio** - you can tell a lot about someone just by looking at their pictures. Plus, **it forces you to get creative** if you constrain yourself, for instance every has to be unique, done in different places or poses and so on.

Today, I checked my Instagram profile and thought: *Why don't I post more often?* **The answer is written in the first sentence**, in case you didn't notice, **but I came up with a solution** to that problem.

**Take one selfie every day.**

Doesn’t that sound exciting? **I’ll post all of them**, and over time they will accumulate into a collection. I don’t know why, but the **idea feels weirdly fascinating**. Not sure if I should set an end date for this mini-experiment, though. Maybe it’s better to let it naturally become a habit and **keep going as long as I can**.

So I guess **I'll start right now**. Perfect way to end this post.
