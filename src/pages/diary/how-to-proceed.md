I can't see what I'm going to do in three months. It feels like **I'm walking in the fog**.

There are so many things I love doing and would happily devote myself to. But **liking something isn't enough** - there's another critical factor: money. **Just to exist already requires decent income** (rent alone is brutally expensive). *And who only wants to exist?* **Everyone wants to live fully** - to grow, to feel alive, to explore new places and ideas.

**The thought of working in an office** for eight hours a day **kills me**. **I crave deep work** and will gladly lose myself in projects for hours, **but money alone canâ€™t motivate me for too long**. Work without any purpose quickly becomes meaningless.

I need to find a way to sustain myself while being able to **explore different fields and aspects of life**. *Turns out making money on your own is not that easy. Or is it?* The thing is, **I probably overestimate the difficulty**, and being afraid of failing, I simply choose to do nothing.

Yet in this time of uncertainty, **there is no room for waiting**. The best thing I can do is to plan less and **try more**. Preparing has its value, but it's so easy to accidentally trap yourself in an infinite loop. There are a lot of things you simply cannot predict without getting halfway through, and at that point **obsessive planning won't help you**.

It's ideal time to **stop complaining** and **start acting**.
