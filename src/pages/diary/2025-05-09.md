A few days ago, I wrote about creating a strict schedule. That's actually going to be my main goal for today. I'm really curious to see how it'll feel and to what degree it will improve my productivity and habit formation.

Also, yesterday I forgot to write about the biggest thing I did - I cut my hair! In the middle of the process, it really seemed like I'd completely messed up the haircut, but in the end, it turned out pretty solid. Yeah, it's not perfect - cutting your own hair while only being able to judge it through a mirror is difficult, but I'm really getting kinda good at this. I guess that's pretty reasonable, the more you do, the better you get.
