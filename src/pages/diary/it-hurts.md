I don't feel well. I've been making a lot of mistakes, or perhaps, I've become more aware of the mistakes I make, which is progress. However, I still haven't gotten out of the habit of occasionally recalling uncomfortable and embarrassing experiences. When this happens, it hurts so much that I can't think about anything but the pain. It paralyzes me at the most inconvenient moments. I hate it. Fixing these kinds of problems is insanely difficult. They are so obscure and complex that I often struggle just to come up with a plan of action to solve them. Yet, these are the most important problems to address as they are the basis of our emotions and dictate our behavior. Hopefully I'll find the answers soon.
