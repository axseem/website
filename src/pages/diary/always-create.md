After a long time, Iâ€™ve written a new blog post: [Embrace The Range](../../blog/embrace-the-range). In it, I discuss the book I just finished and the thoughts that emerged while reading it. Though concise, the post feels pretty polished, covers an interesting topic, so I'm pleased with how it turned out. I especially enjoyed the process of creating the illustration for it. What a great start to a great day!
