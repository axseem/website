I did it again. Yeah... It's already late. I was putting off writing in this diary the whole day, and so here we are. I'm honestly kinda tired of it.

Generally, recently, I've been giving in to my in-the-moment urges quite often. I'm constantly consuming while producing way too little. It's such an annoying habit.

Nevertheless, today I drew pixel-art panels for my Twitch channel. I hadn't done pixel art in a while. The process was really awesome, and the result is on that same level. Creating stuff is an amazing feeling.
