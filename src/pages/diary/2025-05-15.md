So, yesterday I got a roll of ABS filament for my printer. I tried it for printing keycaps, and oh man, it's insanely good! I'm confused why so many people underrate this filament. Yeah, it can warp a bit, but it's honestly not that bad, and I can't say it's much worse than PLA. It's also about 20% lighter than PLA or PETG, since its density is only ~1g/cm³ compared to their ~1.25g/cm³. And the most shocking thing? The surface quality is outstanding. That's already a remarkable set of traits, but on top of that, it's pretty tough and has great UV resistance. Now I regret ordering those five rolls of PLA and PETG filament before testing this other popular one.
