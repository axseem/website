HA! Here is another diary record. Honestly, I don’t feel like I have a lot to say. It was a great day. I dealt with a lot of problems. One thing I can highlight is cleaning my NixOS configuration. Having everything in one file was no longer usable. Also, I used this as an opportunity to [share](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1iwa4op/hyprland_simple_nixosasahi_configuration/) my [dotfiles](https://github.com/axseem/dotfiles) on [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/), where it was warmly received.

I like sharing what I’ve done. I like to hear what others think about things. I like to talk about my thoughts. I like to help solve problems. I like people. It’s better to do more of such things considering how much pleasure and opportunities they gift. Social interactions are a great way to significantly improve yourself in almost every possible way.
