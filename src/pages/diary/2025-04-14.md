Last week I ordered a 3D printer. I need it to make enclosures for keyboards I plan on building to sell, though I suspect I'll find plenty of other interesting ways to use it too. It's supposed to arrive in a few days and I'm really excited.

I also need to sort out the paperwork to become legally self-employed. Honestly, that's the first thing I should've done. I've been putting it off for way too long. Time to take it seriously.
