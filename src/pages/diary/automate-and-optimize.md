Today I woke up at 4:30. It’s a great feeling. By the time I go to the gym, I have two hours for reading, an hour for writing in my journal, and breakfast. I’ll return home around 9:00–9:30 a.m., leaving just one daily task: taking a selfie. By 10:00 a.m., when the day barely begins, most of my routine will already be done, freeing up time for other activities. Optimizing my schedule for productivity is wildly addictive.  

Where does this urge to automate everything come from? It feels innate, almost like a core part of human nature. Maybe that’s why our species evolved so rapidly. We discovered a faster way to progress, bypassing slow genetic adaptations that take millennia. Instead, we arm ourselves with time-efficient tools we create ourselves - tools we can use to build newer, better versions of themselves, accelerating progress endlessly.
