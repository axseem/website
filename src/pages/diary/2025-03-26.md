Yesterday `Deepseek V3 0324` and `Gemini 2.5 Pro` were released. It's amazing how much better LLMs are getting, seemingly week by week. I've been using them much more extensively in all sorts of my everyday routines, and they already provide huge benefits. It's interesting to think about how far this progress acceleration will go. It's really a great time to live in.

There is still this feeling that I should do more than I'm currently doing. It's often overwhelming, but I guess it has to be this way. I like making progress in all aspects of my life, and the only way to achieve that is to keep growing. Either way, it's mentally hard, yet doing nothing also provides absolutely no results, so I'll deal with this slight feeling of being overwhelmed.
