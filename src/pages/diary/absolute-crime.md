I care too much about completely worthless stuff. Because of that, I spend most of my time worrying about things that do not matter instead of doing what I truly want. Classic me! Making the same mistake all over again. Putting other people's goals over my own is objectively stupid, but somehow it just happens automatically. Childhood conditioning? Probably. At least I now recognize this nonsense – that's progress, right?

The weather recently has been unusually amazing. Spring has only just begun but we're already hitting ~15°C during the day. The sun's out here doing overtime – rising earlier, shining like it's getting performance bonuses, and actually radiating warmth. Didn't realize my soul needed UV rays this badly. At this point, staying indoors feels like committing daylight robbery against myself. Time to go touch some grass.
