So, I got an email from Pure Storage â€“ I was rejected. It's a bit upsetting, but I'm okay with it. There were a lot of red flags and a lack of transparency during the interview process, so in the end, it might be for the best.

Anyway, yesterday evening I was programming on stream, implementing Apple's dot matrix display animated wallpaper in a browser. It felt so unbelievably good. After the stream ended, I had to really fight the urge to keep programming it all night and went to bed instead. So, I guess I'll be programming for most of this today.
