+++

Yesterday was such a funny day. In the morning I ran out of meat, so I decided to quickly fix that. I ate three peanut butter sandwiches and went to the supermarket. I visited every single one in my region and found exactly zero chicken fillets. At this point I was forced to take a ride to the center. "No way, after an hour of rambling I finally managed to buy 3kg of chicken fillets," I thought on my way home.

On arriving I went straight to cooking. Recently I've tried to grind the meat instead of chopping it. It takes much less time and additionally meat doesn't get stuck in the teeth, which is a huge benefit. So... I began grinding the meat in my blender. Somewhere in the middle of the process the least expected thing happened. My blender fired! Its handle sparkled for a moment accompanied by a zap sound. Almost immediately, smoke started coming out of it. It was absolutely cooked. Apparently, I'd been grinding for way too long :)

Although I was kinda upset, nothing bad happened. I just threw it away and proceeded with cooking. I guess it will be a lesson for me 0_o
