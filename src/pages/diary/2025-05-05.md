Finally getting back to the gym! Last week was so tough that I skipped it for a bit. Probably a bad move, looking back, since hitting the gym actually helps me de-stress so much.

Anyway, I'm also getting back to writing in my diary early in the morning. Woke up at 6:50 today and feel absolutely awesome. I have a job interview tomorrow, so I'll be preparing heavily for the next couple of days.
