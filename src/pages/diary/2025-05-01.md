This morning I slept in quite a bit. I decided not to fight the urge to fall back asleep after waking up, and grabbed an additional two hours. I feel absolutely great.

My plan for today is to continue practicing concurrency in Go and review data structures and algorithms. I'll also be streaming the process, like I always do. That's pretty much how I'll be spending the next few days, since I'm preparing for a technical interview. Honestly, I feel pretty confident in my skills already and would be okay taking it even today, but it's never a bad idea to practice, especially since I've got the time for it.
