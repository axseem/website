Okay, so another day writing a diary. **I’m pretty happy** with how everything’s going. The progress over the past few days has is already noticeable, and **becoming hyper self-aware made a huge difference**.

I’ve been thinking about this diary recently, and I’ll probably have to change how I do it. First of all, after posting my diary publicly, I’ve noticed that **I’ve started to overthink and filter** everything I write. That’s not great, but **continuing to share** everything openly might **eventually fix the problem** over time.

There’s one important question I struggle to answer though. *How much does it matter that someone is reading what you write?* The problem is that **I’m highly addicted to the attention**. No matter what I do, if I’m the only one who knows about it, I quickly lose interest. It’s not ideal. There are always periods when **you have to grind** without having any quick results, and **patience** in those moments **is the key**.

Clearly, my writing is **far from being valuable** to others, **but** the only way to improve is to **keep writing**.

All my previous posts were shared on my Instagram stories so my friends would notice. That way, I tried to create at least some **illusion of importance** around what I’m doing, but it’s probably **not a healthy habit**. Because of that, I’ll likely **stop reposting everything** on social media and **only share my best work**. Those who care about everything I write will find new post on my website on their own anyway.

Finally, I plan to **rebuild the website** from the ground up. I want to make it more **structured, cleaner, and easier to use**. The key features I want to add are separate pages for blog and diary, plus an option to opt-in for **notifications** about new posts.

So far it seems like I'm moving in the right direction. Everything else is pretty simple - just **do not stop grinding**.
