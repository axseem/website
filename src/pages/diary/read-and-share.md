I need a project. Something that I can potentially grow into a startup, or at least learn something from.

Recently, I came up with an interesting idea. The plan is to build a social platform for book reading. It will allow users to easily discover what they would like to read, find out what other people are currently into, and see what authors think about other books. The platform will promote small writers and prioritize quality content. Additionally, I would like to integrate a cross-platform reader and be able to host popular books and articles right on the website, all of which will be available to read via a monthly subscription.

Seems like a potentially good concept. It could fill a nice niche, as not a lot of people are reading these days, and it has a chance to turn into a bigger project, considering the growing trend of conscious content consumption and self-improvement. Also, it is a fully digital project (unlike my previous one), which means it will be much easier for people to try it, making it easier to gain public awareness.

And last but not least, I would personally want to use such an app. I love reading, and recently have been spending a lot of time with it, but the user experience is far behind compared to other popular forms of content. Making it easier and more enjoyable to read and learn might have a hugely positive impact on humanity as a whole.
