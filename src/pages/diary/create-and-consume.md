I soldered a keyboard yesterday. I had already forgotten how much fun it is. Creating things that have not existed before is a wonderful feeling. I will send it to the US tomorrow. I hope the recipient will enjoy using it as much as I did creating it.

Also, for some reason, music is much more enjoyable lately. For a moment, it makes me feel like I am in a different world. Sometimes I like to just sit and dissolve in it for hours. It feels amazing.
