The 3D printer arrived yesterday. Assembly was pretty easy, and just about an hour after bringing it home, I already had the first model printing - the Benchy, since it was already on the USB drive included in the package. I'm actually really impressed by how good the print quality is already. I'm curious how much better it's gonna get after some detailed calibration.
