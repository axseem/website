I have no desire to do anything. I feel like there is no point in anything I do. Clearly, this is a temporary feeling that will probably go away soon. Nevertheless, it is extremely frustrating. The fact that I know that the feeling is deceptive, or that it will fade with time, doesn't make me feel any better. Maybe that's me who makes it worse by constantly focusing on the problems? Probably, but I wish I knew how to fix that.

Recently, I've noticed that I have become more anxious. The world is changing so rapidly, and time is passing so quickly. I'm afraid of falling behind and not being able to catch up later. Every time I'm about to do something useful, I just get paralyzed, leaving me with no power to move forward.

I'm deeply unhappy with how everything is going, even though I try to pretend that I'm doing well. Obviously, everything is far from bad. There is no reason for me to feel so down, yet I just can't help myself. Every time it seems like I'm starting to understand something, that understanding is soon shattered by the realization of how much I still don't know. It's almost as if I can never be sure about anything. It gets way to overwhelming.
