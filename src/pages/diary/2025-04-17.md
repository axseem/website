Yesterday was awful. I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown. That feeling came on kind of spontaneously and was pretty intense. There are just way too many problems. Loneliness is the biggest one. I had an urge to cry out, but I quickly realized that there aren't any people around me I would want to do that turn to. I really can't understand it. It feels like the problem is me, but is it really? Is it okay that I don't have friends I would want to be with during such a difficult time? 

It's hard for me to like people, but I don't hate them either. I'm really a peaceful and kind person, and I almost never stay angry or hold a grudge against anyone. I'm just not interested. The thing is, I really want to be, but I'm just not. Why is it that way? Am I doing something wrong? Those are the questions that always follow me.

I wish I could try therapy, but I can't afford it. Luckily, I live in a time when progress is faster than ever. It was hard keeping all these feelings inside, so I decided to chat with an LLM, specifically `Gemini 2.5 Pro`. It always feels kind of weird, but it works well enough. I even saw a paper suggesting that people sometimes prefer answers from AI over human therapists, as AI text can apparently seem more empathetic. It helped me feel a bit better and see things a bit clearer, but it's still tough.
